Encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and myelitis, or inflam­
mation of the spinal cord, cause myriad symptoms and signs because 
of the subtle behavioral phenotypes and varying locations of the 
inflammation. The lesions are hard to categorize or quantify and are 
not generally accessible to biopsy. The challenge in relatively nonverbal 
children compounds the problem. Encephalopathy, or dysfunction 
of alertness, attention, cognition, and speech, has a much broader dif­
ferential diagnosis (see Chapter 31). For this reason, the diagnosis of 
encephalomyelitis (EM) usually requires fevers or an objective neuro­
logic sign to open the investigation (Table 42.1).
Encephalitis is uncommon (0.3–0.5/100,000 population) and is only 
one of many etiologies of altered mental status including the broad cat­
egory of noninfectious noninflammatory encephalopathies (see Chapter 
41). Indeed, encephalitis may be due to infections of the central nervous 
system, as well as immune-mediated processes (active, postinfectious), 
autoimmune (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor [NMDAR] antibody, oth­
ers), or overlapping (HSV with NMDAR encephalitis, COVID-19 with 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM]).
ETIOLOGY
Encephalitis may be infectious, postinfectious, autoinflammatory, or 
autoimmune (Table 42.2). The approach to the epidemiology of enceph­
alitis must take age (see Table 42.2) and exposure (Table 42.3) into 
consideration. Exposures include other affected people in addition to 
insects (mosquitoes, ticks, others), animals (bats, dogs, cats, raccoons, 
sheep, goats), ingestion or inhalation (water, soil, foods), the season, and 
travel to endemic areas. Although many cases of encephalitis have no 
identifiable exposures, particularly autoimmune encephalitis, a careful 
history may improve the ability to make a diagnosis and provide specific 
therapy (brucellosis, Baylisascaris procyonis, Naegleria fowleri).
In addition to infectious etiologies, autoimmune encephalitis 
must always be considered in the differential diagnosis (Tables 42.4, 
42.5, 42.6, and 42.7). Subacute or chronic encephalitis, particularly in 
immunosuppressed patients, has a different epidemiology (Table 42.8). 
In addition, many systemic disorders mimic encephalitis (Table 42.9) 
(see Chapter 31).
Herpes simplex is the most important treatable infectious endemic 
cause of encephalitis in the United States. Seasonal fluctuations of asep­
tic meningitis and/or encephalitis are often due to enteroviruses/pare­
choviruses and arboviruses (arthropod-­borne virus) such as West Nile, 
Powassan, St. Louis, California, Eastern and Western equine, and La 
Crosse viruses. Zika, dengue, and Chikungunya are also arboviruses. 
In endemic areas and during the appropriate season, tick-­borne dis­
eases (Lyme disease) should be considered.
Autoimmune encephalitis, ADEM, and neuromyelitis optica spec­
trum disorder (NMOSD) are important, recognizable, noninfectious-­
inflammatory treatable disorders that commonly present with an 
encephalitis-­like picture.
Autoimmune Encephalitis
Autoimmune encephalitis is often associated with behavioral or psy­
chiatric changes and seizures; the MRI may be normal, but the EEG 
will universally be abnormal. The presence of restricted diffusion or 
contrast enhancement is unusual in autoimmune encephalitis. The 
most common form of autoimmune encephalitis is caused by anti­
bodies to the NMDA­ receptor (NMDAR), which in children is often 
associated with agitation, hallucination, sleep disorder, movement 
disorders (or catatonia), ataxia, mutism, and seizures. Inflammatory 
markers are often normal. NMDAR encephalitis is uncommonly para­
neoplastic in children (more so in adolescents) and usually of ovarian 
origin. NMDAR encephalitis can be triggered by HSV encephalitis and 
Japanese encephalitis virus, which confounds the primary diagnosis. 
Other relatively antibody-­mediated syndromes include myelin oligo­
dendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and GAD65.
The most common, cell-­mediated autoimmune encephalitis is acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a bilateral, asymmetric 
demyelinating syndrome presenting 2–4 weeks after a minor respira­
tory or gastrointestinal infection; it has also been reported after mea­
sles, historical smallpox and neural tissue–derived rabies vaccines, 
trauma, or surgery. Encephalopathy is present in >90% of patients; 
fever is not. Often there is paresis of the cranial nerves or extremities. 
Imaging is usually abnormal in most cases (Fig. 42.1). ADEM is cell 
mediated, but a subset of patients, usually with more severe disease, 
show peripheral antibodies to MOG; some with MOG antibodies have 
a course distinct from ADEM. Epidemiologic (Fig. 42.2) and MRI find­
ings (Table 42.10) may help differentiate ADEM from MS. Corticoste­
roids are often used despite inconclusive evidence; rapid withdrawal of 
corticosteroids may result in relapse.
Acute transverse myelitis (TM) clinically mimics cord transection 
(sensory, motor, and sphincter impairment) at a precise spinal level, but 
MRI usually demonstrates cord inflammation extending more than three 
vertebral bodies. It is essential to emergently exclude spinal cord compres­
sion by epidural abscess, hematoma, or tumor. Sparing of proprioception 
and vibration suggests possible anterior spinal artery disease (vasculitis, 
infarction, syphilis, schistosomiasis). Therapy is not established, and out­
comes vary. Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) (or acute flaccid paralysis) 
is a syndrome associated with TM with anterior horn cell involvement, 
typically in younger children, occurring seasonally. Recovery is vari­
able. There has been irregular geographic coincidence with outbreaks of 
enterovirus (EV) D-­68 and coxsackievirus A-­16, but virus is usually not 
detected in CSF. Outbreaks of AFM have occurred in other regions with­
out detection of these viruses despite aggressive diagnostic surveillance.
The most common treatable cause of sporadic encephalitis at 
all ages is caused by herpes simplex virus. Apart from the neonatal 
period, when the virus spreads hematogenously, encephalitis is medi­
ated by reactivation of the virus in the trigeminal nerve and spread 
to the innervated base of the brain (frontal and temporal lobes). The

proximity of the innervated dura to CSF explains the remarkably high 
sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HSV enceph­
alitis (93%) relative to those for hematogenous neonatal HSV enceph­
alitis (70%). The virus is highly cytolytic, causing tissue necrosis. Early 
CSF findings do not distinguish HSV from other encephalitides; hem­
orrhagic CSF with a high protein level signifies necrotic brain lesions. 
Acyclovir requires a virally expressed thymidine kinase for activity, 
which directly matches potential cellular toxicity with antiviral effect. 
Acyclovir will crystalize in the kidneys unless hydration is aggressive.
The most common cause of epidemic infectious encephalitis is 
the enteroviruses. Enteroviruses cause summer outbreaks of aseptic 
meningitis without measurable neurologic deficits. Why they should 
on occasion mimic necrotizing HSV encephalitis in unclear; the rarity 
of the event raises consideration for a second-­hit hypothesis. Entero­
viruses include poliomyelitis viruses, the historical cause of epidemic 
acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Nonpolio enteroviruses have been 
associated temporally with biannual outbreaks of AFM, with dif­
ferent clinical, radiologic, and virologic patterns than polio. Acute 
poliomyelitis is restricted to anterior motor neurons in the spine, caus­
ing asymmetric flaccid paralysis with leg pain but without sensory or 
autonomic disturbances. Detection of virus in the CSF is common. 
Enteroviruses are naturally cleared by immunoglobulins, so patients 
with hypogammaglobulinemia are at high risk of a slow, chronic 
encephalitis due to enteroviruses.
Influenza viruses cause yearly outbreaks of severe respiratory illness 
and may be the most common precipitant of acute metabolic diseases 
causing encephalopathy, including Reye syndrome (medium-­chain 
acylcarnitine deficiency [MCAD] deficiency), acute hemorrhagic 
shock and encephalopathy, acute necrotizing (thalamic, RANBP2) 
encephalopathy, acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and 
restricted diffusion, hemiconvulsion/hemiplegia syndrome, and mild 
encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesions. These syndromes 
are characterized by acute febrile illness, brain edema, hepatitis and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in some, and seizures. 
Syndromes vary by ethnicity and geography. All respiratory viruses 
associated with these syndromes are common and several are restricted

TABLE 42.4  Diagnostic Criteria for Definite Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis
Diagnosis can be made when all four* of the following criteria have been met:
	1.	Subacute onset (rapid progression of <3 mo) of working memory deficits, seizures, or psychiatric symptoms suggesting involvement of the limbic system
	2.	Bilateral brain abnormalities on T2-­weighted fluid-­attenuated inversion recovery MRI highly restricted to the medial temporal lobes†
	3.	At least one of the following:
 • CSF pleocytosis (white blood cell count of >5 cells/mm3)
 • EEG with epileptic or slow-­wave activity involving the temporal lobes
	4.	Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes
CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.
*If one of the first three criteria is not met, a diagnosis of definite limbic encephalitis can be made only with the detection of antibodies against cell-­
surface, synaptic, or onconeural proteins.
†18-­Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-­FDG) PET can be used to fulfill this criterion. Results from studies from the past 5 yr suggest that 18F-­FDG-­PET imaging 
might be more sensitive than MRI to show an increase in FDG uptake in normal-­appearing medial temporal lobes.

TABLE 42.5  Diagnostic Criteria for Definite Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis
Diagnosis can be made when all five of the following criteria have been met:
	1.	A first multifocal, clinical CNS event of presumed inflammatory demyelinating cause
	2.	Encephalopathy that cannot be explained by fever
	3.	Abnormal brain MRI:
 • Diffuse, poorly demarcated, large (>1–2 cm) lesions predominantly involving the cerebral white matter
 • T1-­hypointense lesions in the white matter in rare cases
 • Deep gray matter abnormalities (e.g., thalamus or basal ganglia) can be present
	4.	No new clinical or MRI findings after 3 mo of symptom onset
	5.	Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes
CNS, central nervous system.

TABLE 42.6  Diagnostic Criteria for Anti-­NMDA Receptor Encephalitis
Probable Anti-­NMDA Receptor Encephalitis*
Diagnosis can be made when all three of the following criteria have been met:
	1.	Rapid onset (<3 mo) of at least four of the six following major groups of symptoms:
 • Abnormal (psychiatric) behavior or cognitive dysfunction
 • Speech dysfunction (pressured speech, verbal reduction, mutism)
 • Seizures
 • Movement disorder, dyskinesias, or rigidity/abnormal postures
 • Decreased level of consciousness
 • Autonomic dysfunction or central hypoventilation
	2.	At least one of the following laboratory study results:
 • Abnormal EEG (focal or diffuse slow or disorganized activity, epileptic activity, or extreme delta brush)
 • CSF with pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands
	3.	Reasonable exclusion of other disorders 
Diagnosis can also be made in the presence of three of the above groups of symptoms accompanied by a systemic teratoma
Definite Anti-­NMDA Receptor Encephalitis*
Diagnosis can be made in the presence of one or more of the six major groups of symptoms and IgG anti-­GluN1 antibodies,† after reasonable exclusion of other 
disorders (appendix)

*Patients with a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in the previous weeks might have relapsing immune-­mediated neurologic symptoms 
(post–herpes simplex virus encephalitis).
†Antibody testing should include testing of CSF. If only serum is available, confirmatory tests should be included (e.g., live neurons or tissue immu­
nohistochemistry, in addition to cell-­based assay).

	1.	Subacute onset (rapid progression of <4 wk) of all the following symptoms:
 • Decreased level of consciousness
 • Bilateral external ophthalmoplegia
 • Ataxia
	2.	Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes
Definite Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis

to mucosal surfaces (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], 
rotavirus). Half of patients (other than those with splenial lesions) have 
neurologic sequelae. MRI findings confirm the anatomic diagnosis. 
The presence of cardiomyopathy or liver failure with encephalopa­
thy may also suggest a mitochondrial disorder. The empirical use of 
nucleoside analogs as antivirals in patients with possible mitochondrial 
disorders risks unbalancing nucleoside pools to cause further mito­
chondrial DNA loss.
CNS vasculitis and vasculopathies are mostly secondary to 
other inflammatory processes (see Chapter 37). The distinction of 
encephalitis and CNS vasculitis is partly semantic because enceph­
alitis involves the neurovascular unit and perivenular inflammation 
is a regular pathologic finding in encephalitis. Systemic infections 
(rickettsia), virus reactivations (varicella-­zoster virus [VSV]), and

encephalopathy. Autoimmune forms of vasculitis include innate 
inflammopathies (pyrin, interferon, and complement disorders) as 
well as antibody-­mediated (system lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and 
cell-­mediated (Rasmussen) processes. Primary small-­vessel vasculitis 
has a long prodrome and often presents subtly, including encepha­
lopathies, developmental regression, and behavioral and psychiatric 
symptoms. Inflammatory markers are elevated and oligoclonal bands 
are present in one third of cases. MRI may be normal or demonstrate 
demyelination (but with meningeal enhancement) or cord lesions. 
Contrast enhancement is variable; there is no restricted diffusion. 
Diagnosis may require brain biopsy but does not require targeting of 
a radiologic lesion. Granulomatous inflammation is more common in 
adults than children.

Evaluation
Evaluation is considered in cases of encephalitis or encephalopa­
thy in association with fevers or focal neurologic signs. Symptoms 
are difficult to elicit in preverbal children, but speech, behavior, 
and sleep are often affected. Important findings on physical exam 
are noted in Table 42.11. Objective motor signs include myoclonus, 
myoclonic seizures, tremors, dyskinesias, abnormalities of tone, 
and ataxia. Dysautonomia is often present. CT of the head is rarely 
useful other than to detect gross edema, midline shifts, obstructive 
hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, or calcifications. MRI 
provides exquisite detail and can differentiate strokes, gray matter 
involvement, demyelination, and large-­vessel vasculitis (see Chapter 
37) (Fig. 42.3). MRI should include T2, fluid-­attenuated inversion 
recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-­weighted imaging (DWI), and intrave­
nous contrast to differentiate disorders. Magnetic resonance angiog­
raphy or magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be indicated. EEG is 
generally not specific but universally has an abnormal background 
with or without seizures; EEG is normal in pediatric autoimmune 
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infec­
tions (PANDAS)/pediatric acute-­onset neuropsychiatric syndrome 
(PANS) and psychiatric disorders.
There are myriad causes of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis 
(Tables 42.12, 4.13, and 4.14).

*This table is not intended to encompass all causes of encephalitis, nor all epidemiologic or laboratory-­based risk factors. We recommend utilizing 
this table as a guideline for initial management of acute encephalitis in children beyond the neonatal period. For additional information, we rec­
ommend consulting Tunkel et al. 2008, Steiner et al. 2010, Kneen et al. 2012 (see Bibliography). Consultation with local health authorities is also 
recommended.
†Although some members of the consortium recommended M. pneumoniae CSF PCR as routine testing for all children, a consensus was not 
reached given the challenges of establishing a diagnosis of encephalitis due to M. pneumoniae (see text).
‡MTB testing includes CSF smear for acid-­fast bacilli and CSF mycobacterial culture along with one or more of the number of MTB PCR tests for 
CSF now commercially available. Sensitivity of smear and culture increases with the volume of CSF analyzed; we recommend consulting with the 
laboratory regarding optimal volumes of CSF to be analyzed. Given the varying sensitivity of these tests, systemic MTB testing including tuberculin 
skin test (may be negative) or interferon-­γ release assay, stains and cultures from sputum, and tissue from biopsies from any potential systemic 
sites of infection.
§Fungal testing should be tailored to specific geographic region and prior travel history/place of residence, and typically consists of serology, antibody 
testing from urine and/or CSF, and cultures from blood and CSF.
||Arbovirus testing should be tailored to specific geographic region and typically consists of IgG and IgM from serum and CSF; PCR (serum, CSF) can 
be performed for select arboviruses (i.e., WNV, California serogroup viruses), and is particularly useful in immunocompromised patients.
¶Rabies/ABLV testing includes serologic analysis of serum and CSF; virus isolation or RT-­PCR from saliva; and tests for viral antigen or histopathology 
on either a brain biopsy or full-­thickness biopsy of the nape of the neck. Testing should be conducted in concert with a local or regional public health 
department.
**Tickborne disease testing should be tailored to specific geographic region and typically consists of serology (i.e., Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia sp., 
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, tickborne encephalitis virus) and blood PCR (Ehrlichia, Anaplasma).
††N. fowleri, B. mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba spp. testing is only available at specialized laboratories (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Preven­
tion) and includes serum immunofluorescence assay, immunohistochemistry on brain or other tissue, and PCR testing on brain or other tissue and 
CSF. In addition, CSF wet mount is recommended for N. fowleri testing. Brain tissue from affected region offers optimal sensitivity and specificity 
but other specimens can be tested.
‡‡Respiratory virus testing includes either culture or respiratory PCR panel from respiratory specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash). 
Respiratory virus testing should include influenza A and B (during influenza season). Testing for other respiratory viruses including parainfluenza 1–4, 
adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus should be considered, although their role in causing CNS illness is controversial.
§§Autoimmune limbic encephalitis evaluation includes testing for antibodies to VGKC, GAD, AMPA receptor, GABAb receptor, mgluR5, Hu, CV2, Ma2, 
and amphiphysin.
||||Limited testing may be available through research laboratories and includes examination of CSF or other affected tissues (i.e., eye, muscle) for 
presence of parasite or detection of antibody in serum or CSF.

DIAGNOSTIC EMERGENCIES: OTHER DISEASES TO 
EXCLUDE
Encephalomyelitis
 • Bacterial meningitis. Highly damaging; screening by blood cul­
ture, CSF, Gram stain, and CSF cytochemical profile; easily diag­
nosed by culture and with highly effective antibacterial therapies. 
Most common bacteria are detected by CSF nucleic acid amplifi­
cation test (NAAT) panels. Lumbar puncture should be performed 
immediately if no localizing signs are present by exam (see Chapter 
52). Ultrasonography for optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) at 
bedside accurately estimates intracranial pressure to enable prompt 
lumbar puncture. Increased ONSD can also be detected by MRI 
in coronal and axial views. Practitioners must consider obtaining 
enough CSF to avoid delays in other time-­sensitive diseases, such as 
herpes simplex encephalitis.
 • Herpes simplex encephalitis. The most common cause of sporadic 
encephalitis (HSV-1), and causal of an aseptic meningitis syndrome 
(HSV type 2) during genital flares. Highly necrotizing but can be 
diagnosed with high sensitivity (93%) by NAAT testing in CSF 
when symptoms present for more than 4 days (otherwise requiring 
a later sample) and with safe, effective antiviral therapies. Screening 
for HSV is included in most clinical CSF NAAT panels.
 • Fever-­associated epileptic encephalopathies. Various genetic 
or idiopathic disorders characterized by preceding or concurrent 
fever may manifest with seizures (often refractory status epilepti­
cus) and encephalopathy. Dravet syndrome (SCN1A, unknown), 
Alpers syndrome (POLG1), and early epileptic encephalopathy 
type 9 (PCDH19) are examples of genetic epilepsy encephalop­
athies precipitated by fever. Febrile infection–related epilepsy 
syndrome (FIRES) and new-­onset refractory status epilepti­
cus (NORSE) are catastrophic idiopathic disorders preceded by a 
febrile illness 24 hours to 2 weeks prior to the onset of the epileptic 
encephalopathy.
Acute Flaccid Paresis/Paralysis (Without 
Encephalopathy)
 • Bacterial epidural abscess, hematoma, and tumor must be excluded. 
Screening requires exam of the spine and bedside ultrasonography 
and MRI before lumbar puncture.

CHAPTER 42  Encephalitis
ADEM
 • CNS lymphoma. Rare but empirical corticosteroid therapy for 
ADEM may compromise later diagnostic profiling and chemother­
apeutic response. Diagnostics and therapeutics are well based on 
evidence. Screening requires cytology of CSF cells.
 • Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Rare, genetic or 
secondary to another disease. Often requires chemotherapy and 
stem cell transplantation. Diagnostics and therapeutics are well 
based on evidence. Screening is aided by cytology of CSF cells 
(hemophagocytosis) and high serum ferritin. May initially present 
with only CNS symptoms.
COVID-19 ASSOCIATED CNS MANIFESTATIONS
Severe neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infections are noted in 
~5% of hospitalized patients with respiratory failure and those with mul­
tisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Potential etiolo­
gies of neurologic disorders in patients with COVID-19 include cytokine 
hyperinflammation and neuroimmune (antibody or T-cell) induced 
direct CNS injury. The spectrum of manifestations is broad and includes 
encephalopathy, seizures, delirium, ADEM, psychosis, Guillain-Barré syn­
drome, and MERS (mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesions). 
In addition to neuroimmune-mediated inflammations, patients are also at 
risk for cerebrovascular disease (ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke).
   	 S U MMA RY  A N D  R E D  F L A G S
Depending on the epidemiology, the etiology of infectious encephalitis 
becomes readily apparent with MRI and examining the CSF or other 
fluids. Presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis or ADEM 
may initially be facilitated by diagnostic criteria including MRI and 
EEG; therapy should not be delayed while waiting for results on auto­
immune antibody panels (see Tables 42.4 to 42.7).
Red flags include coma, papilledema or signs of impending brain 
herniation, hemiplegia, autonomic dysfunction, a distinct cord level, 
exposure to high-­risk vectors (rabies, etc.), being immunosuppressed, 
and travel to endemic areas.
