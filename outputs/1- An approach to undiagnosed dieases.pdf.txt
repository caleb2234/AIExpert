SECTION 1  Symptom-Based Diagnosis
“Getting the right diagnosis is a key aspect of health care, as it 
provides an explanation of a patient’s health problem and informs 
subsequent health care decisions.”
The Institute of Medicine; The National Academies of Sciences, Engi­
neering, and Medicine, 2015
At its core, medicine is committed to identifying, preventing, and 
treating disease to maintain or restore health. Fundamental to this 
commitment is diagnosis, the process of uncovering the cause of a 
patient’s health-­related concerns. Patients rarely present to their phy­
sicians with a diagnosis already identified, even with the widespread 
and increasing availability of health-­related information and technol­
ogy. Rather, patients present with a symptom: a subjective physical 
finding, sensation, or phenomenon that indicates to them that they 
may no longer be in their baseline state of health. A symptom may be 
accompanied by a sign: an objective finding on physical examination, 
laboratory investigation, or imaging study that indicates an abnormal 
deviation from homeostasis. Some signs, like elevated blood pressure, 
may not be associated with any noticeable symptoms. While not all 
symptoms or signs denote underlying pathophysiology, their mere 
presence is often unsettling to the person experiencing them, requiring 
either reassurance in instances of benign etiologies or a specific diag­
nosis and management plan in instances of pathology. Diagnosis is the 
process by which the health care team uncovers the precise explanation 
for those symptoms and signs so as to inform any subsequent health 
care–related decisions. The diagnostic process is complex, iterative, col­
laborative, often subject to revision, and fraught with the possibility 
of diagnostic error, yet when properly engaged holds the potential for 
restoring a patient to health.
DIAGNOSIS: IT ALL STARTS WITH A SYMPTOM
While asymptomatic individuals may have abnormalities detected on 
screening investigations, most patients enter into the diagnostic process 
by virtue of symptoms. With the exception of certain pathognomonic 
findings, such as Koplik spots in measles, presenting features rarely 
correlate directly and discretely to one individual disease process. It is 
up to the diagnostician to methodically gather information, categoriz­
ing and assigning importance to each historical and physical finding, 
noting both what is present and what is absent, so that this informa­
tion can define the patient’s phenotype, the unique constellation of 
subjective and objective information indicating the functional health 
status of the patient, how current physiology differs in ways that may 
suggest pathology, and the context in which these changes are occur­
ring. Establishing this phenotype is the starting point for developing a 
structured working differential diagnosis, the possible diseases and 
mechanisms by which the patient’s symptoms are produced, which 
then drives additional investigation. This process is not random but 
rather has evolved through years of collective experience and analysis 
into the evidence-­based standard of care (Fig. 1.1). Advances in medi­
cal science have been accompanied by refinements and improvements 
in diagnosis, ranging from enhanced understanding of physiology, 
allowing for more rapid and sophisticated identification of pathology, 
to the development of diagnostic technologies, such as MRI, molecular 
genetic assays, or the use of data aggregation and machine learning, 
allowing for the implementation of artificial intelligence–assisted diag­
nosis (Fig. 1.2).
DIAGNOSIS AS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS
Diagnosis is an iterative process, progressing in a stepwise fashion from 
an undifferentiated primary medical concern, or chief complaint, to 
an identified cause of the patient’s concerns with an associated man­
agement plan. The iterative process often requires one to go back to 
the beginning and, based on new data from the history, physical exam, 
imaging, or diagnostic tests, to re-­evaluate the original hypothesis. 
Regardless of the ways in which diagnostic techniques and modalities 
have advanced over time, the fundamental components of diagnosis 
remain relatively unchanged and begin with establishing the history of 
the presenting concern.
History
The goal of obtaining the medical history is to develop a comprehensive 
yet concise narrative summary of the patient’s primary health concern, 
while placing that concern in the context of the patient’s past medical 
history, determining what social and environmental factors may be 
contributing to the patient’s health, eliciting which health conditions 
may have a familial tendency, and delineating what other symptoms 
or signs may be associated with the presenting concern. The scope of 
history gathering during any patient encounter is highly individualized 
and depends on both the clinician’s experience and the circumstances 
of the encounter; for example, an annual health supervision visit in an

outpatient clinic and an emergency department visit for acute lateral­
ized weakness would generate vastly different sets of questions.
While matching the pace and scope of history gathering to the 
acuity of the patient’s presentation, the physician should conduct the 
medical interview in a manner that establishes trust, confidence, and 
rapport with the patient; creates sufficient space for the patient to tell 
the story; and focuses on eliciting high-­yield information in a timely 
fashion. To accomplish these aims, a combination of patient-­driven, 
clinician-­driven, and evidence-­based medical interview techniques 
are employed. Typically, these interview styles are not implemented 
in isolation, but rather are blended to nurture conversational flow 
while allowing for comprehensive information gathering. The patient-­
centered portions focus on encouraging the patient to express what 
is most important, while the clinician-­centered portions allow the 
physician to expand, clarify, and refine the history so that it is both 
comprehensive and specific. Evidence-­based elements allow for prob­
ing aspects of the history and physical examination with higher-­yield 
questions that help distinguish diagnostic possibilities with a high 
likelihood from those with a lower likelihood. This discrimination is 
best accomplished through the use of key pointer questions. These ques­
tions are often disease or specialty specific and are designed to tease 
out the nuances of relevant or pertinent information during history 
taking. When deciding if a suggestive history and physical examina­
tion are consistent with Kawasaki disease, a rheumatologist knows 
to investigate not simply whether the patient does or does not have 
conjunctivitis, but rather whether conjunctivitis is purulent (exclude), 
nonpurulent (include), limbic sparing (include), or not (exclude). Such 
questions leverage high likelihood ratios for crucial aspects of the his­
tory and physical examination to allow for more rapid refinement of 
the differential diagnosis (Fig. 1.3).
In addition to providing crucial information regarding the patient’s 
concerns, the medical history is an interactive process that allows the 
clinician to establish rapport and hopefully to avoid scenarios in which 
the patient or family state that the clinician “is a good doctor but never 
listens to what I say.” Building trust, setting expectations, and estab­
lishing the primacy of the patient-­clinician relationship can be just as 
crucial as collecting informative data. Listening and being aware of 
nonverbal cues such as vocal inflection and body language can inform 
the data collection process as much as directive questioning. In some 
cases, obtaining that critical piece of information is highly dependent 
on the tone of the relationship between the two parties.
The medical history, and the quality of data obtained from it, can also 
be enhanced by the electronic medical record and the ways in which 
technology has evolved to facilitate good patient care and a good patient 
experience. Pre-­charting, or familiarizing oneself with what is already 
known of the patient’s medical history, should be encouraged for any

CHAPTER 1  Disease Mimics: An Approach to Undiagnosed Diseases
nonurgent health visit, as a comprehensive chart review can save a sig­
nificant amount of time during the patient encounter and can create an 
immediate sense of clinician engagement for the patient, wherein the 
patient knows that the physician has taken an interest in and has an imme­
diate knowledge of the past history. This preparatory information should 
always be confirmed though, as diagnostic labels and medical problem 
lists can sometimes be inaccurate and perpetuate incorrect information 
about the patient that can increase the risk of diagnostic error.
Physical Examination
While advances in medical technology have changed the degree to 
which diagnosis is solely reliant on physical examination findings, 
comprehensive physical examination remains a cornerstone in iden­
tifying key phenotypic features that can then be further informed by 
applying appropriate technologic testing (see Fig. 1.2). The office visit 
is a snapshot in time of the person being evaluated, and not all perti­
nent features are necessarily present for this evaluation: a fever noted 
at home may resolve or a rash may fade by the time of the appoint­
ment; new features may evolve following the medical evaluation. These 
reported findings, even if not present during the actual physical exam­
ination, should still be considered in the diagnostic formulation, given 
that many diseases and their associated findings are dynamic.
When examining a patient, the traditional dichotomous concept 
of “positive” and “negative” findings either supporting or negating the 
possibility of a diagnosis remains important; however, the presence or 
absence of findings is not weighted equally and requires the application 
of evidence to determine significance. When evaluating the signifi­
cance of a finding or result of a test, there are four concepts to consider:

1.4 and 1.5).
Pretest Probability
The pretest probability is the general prevalence of the condition within 
the patient population being evaluated. In this context it is the popula­
tion risk prior to any bias of the examination or testing.
Sensitivity
Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify the presence 
of disease in a population of people who are affected by the disease.
Specificity
Specificity refers to the ability of a test to accurately identify the absence 
of disease through a negative test result.

CHAPTER 1  Disease Mimics: An Approach to Undiagnosed Diseases
Likelihood Ratio
Likelihood ratios (LRs) synthesize sensitivity and specificity of exam­
ination findings or test results to inform the probability of the presence 
or absence of disease for the individual patient. The greater the absolute 
value of the LR, the higher the clinical utility of the test in establishing 
or excluding a particular disease. Thus, it could be seen as a measure 
of how “useful” a particular test is in the context of the diagnosis in 
question. Considered from a diagnostic perspective, it is also a measure 
of the likelihood of the presence or absence of disease in a patient after 
the test has been performed (i.e., the post-­test probability of a specific 
diagnosis). The accuracy of an LR is entirely dependent on the quality 
of data used to generate the LR.
Relying purely on clinical findings, without the aid of additional 
testing, can on occasion lead the physician to the wrong diagnosis. 
Fever, cough, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, headache, tonsillar exudate, 
and palatal petechiae all have low sensitivity and specificity when con­
sidering streptococcal pharyngitis, despite being common findings in 
patients with streptococcal pharyngitis. The positive predictive value 
of these signs and symptoms is no more than 50%; other clinical fea­
tures carry more diagnostic weight: sore throat, tonsillar swelling, ante­
rior cervical adenopathy, and scarlatiniform rash have all been shown 
to have a significant correlation with culture-­positive group A β-­
hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Therefore, it is important to focus 
on features with high likelihood ratios when formulating differential 
diagnoses and testing strategies. When doing so, it may be tempting to 
aggregate likelihood ratios into clinical reasoning, using the post-­test 
probability of one finding to serve as the pretest probability for the next 
finding, but when using these tools, each point needs to be considered 
in isolation and cannot be cascaded to inform one another. In addi­
tion, diseases are often complex, and thinking of disease paradigms as 
either present or absent does not account for the real-­life variability in 
clinical presentation and severity that results from the unique inter­
play between the patient’s individual health status and the dynamic 
nature of many diseases. It is precisely this interplay that can lead to 
certain unrelated disorders presenting with similar features (mimic), 
or the same disorder presenting differently in different patients or 
with changing features over time in the same patient (chameleon). 
An example of considering mimics in the differential diagnosis while 
looking for distinguishing features is noted in Table 1.1. An example of 
the same disease with different manifestations acting as chameleons is 
noted in Table 1.2. At the gene level there are multiple genes produc­
ing the Noonan phenotype, while one gene (ADA-­2 deficiency) may

SECTION 1  Symptom-Based Diagnosis 
produce what appears as unrelated phenotypes (stroke, cytopenias, 
intestinal lesions). The application of sensitivity, specificity, and LRs 
thus needs to be judicious, with insight into what is being offered to aid 
the question at hand. Applied appropriately, these tools offer an estab­
lished methodology for adjusting disease probability in the context of a 
specific defined parameter (see Fig. 1.4).
Physical examinations have two paradigms, one in which no addi­
tional evidence is required and one that is reliant on advanced testing. 
Certain presenting disorders remain clinical diagnoses. The diagnosis 
of otitis media relies on clinical features: the presence of fever along 
with an erythematous tympanic membrane that has limited mobility 
on pneumatic otoscopy or a middle ear effusion on visual inspection. 
Conversely, the definitive diagnosis of a structural malformation in 
congenital heart disease requires advanced imaging technology such 
as an echocardiogram to accurately make the diagnosis. When there is 
a recognized standard-­of-­care evaluation or investigation that is code­
pendent on the physical findings to achieve a clear clinical diagnosis, 
this element of the physical examination is considered evidence based. 
When considering the example of an adolescent biological male pre­
senting to the emergency room with right-­sided lower quadrant pain, 
requesting a pregnancy test is unlikely to yield an informative result as 
pretest probability is negligible. Rather, applying appropriate clinical 
reasoning and looking for information to support a more decisive diag­
nosis may lead to the consideration of appendicitis (Fig. 1.6).
Incorrect application of these diagnostic aids or inaccurate assim­
ilation of phenotypic data forms the basis of diagnostic error. High-­
quality information, properly synthesized, is important. Diagnostic 
aids such as artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning), even when 
using natural language processing algorithms, require accurate subjec­
tive and objective phenotypic data to perform well.
DIAGNOSIS AS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND 
THE TEAM-­BASED APPROACH
The success of any diagnostic endeavor depends on the nature of the 
relationship forged with the patient, any of the patient’s family mem­
bers or caregivers, and the health care team. The value of any subjec­
tive information gathered, whether it be the narrative history of the 
primary medical concern, the features and nuances of symptoms, the 
context of any associated signs, or the impact on daily life, depends on 
the strength of that relationship and the quality of communication that 
relationship affords.
The success of this team-­based approach to diagnosis extends 
beyond the physician, patient, and the patient’s family and caregiv­
ers. When presentations are atypical or when patients have endured 
diagnostic delays or diagnostic errors, incorporating other health care 
providers into the patient’s care team enhances diagnostic accuracy 
beyond that achieved even by individual experienced expert clini­
cians. The primary aphorism that should drive the evaluation of every 
patient is that “none of us is as smart as all of us”; indeed, collective 
intelligence-­based medical decision-­making has consistently and sig­
nificantly outperformed even the most accurate single diagnostician 
in certain clinical contexts. To the degree possible, each patient evalu­
ation team should be composed of individuals from a wide breadth of 
disciplines and perspectives so as to broaden the collective knowledge 
base and solicit a variety of perspectives on pathophysiology and differ­
ential diagnoses that may not have otherwise been considered had the 
patient been evaluated in individual specialty settings. This collabora­
tive and more deliberate approach to diagnosis additionally encourages 
the generation of multiple diagnostic hypotheses and testing strategies. 
The end goal and product of this process is the group phenotype, 
in which the evaluation team has collectively—as a group—analyzed 
the patient’s primary concerns, physical findings, and objective data 
into discrete phenotypic phenomena. These phenomena can then be 
explored further in attempts to uncover hypothesized underlying and 
unifying pathophysiologic mechanisms that can be investigated with 
further testing.
Diagnostic Error
Despite the best efforts and intentions of the health care team, the diag­
nostic process is at risk for error: depending on the clinical setting, 
diagnostic errors have been identified in up to 15% of patient encoun­
ters. Diagnostic error may consist of a missed, delayed, or wrong diag­
nosis, and the error may be attributable to faults within the structure 
and function of the health care system, such as the unavailability or 
inaccuracy of a particular diagnostic modality, or to factors beyond the 
control of the patient or clinician (e.g., “no fault” error), such as a dis­
ease process presenting with such atypical or subtle features as to com­
pletely preclude proper diagnosis. Most diagnostic error is attributable 
to cognitive errors related to cognitive bias.
Dual process theory holds that clinicians engaging in medical 
reasoning typically utilize either a predominantly intuitive approach, 
termed a system 1 process, or a more analytical approach, termed a 
system 2 process. System 1 processes are based in heuristics, which 
rely on pattern recognition and rules of thumb to rapidly sort large 
amounts of clinical information into an illness script that allows for the

quick elaboration of a diagnosis. System 2 processes, on the other hand, 
rely on deliberate counterfactual reasoning and hypothesis generation 
tailored to individual patient circumstances to arrive at a more robust 
differential diagnosis. While clinicians predominantly engage system 1 
processes and achieve relatively accurate diagnoses for most patients 
under most circumstances, heuristics can fail when patient presenta­
tions are multisystem, atypical, complex, or evolving, instead becoming 
a form of bias that can result in diagnostic error (Table 1.3). Biases may 
also be the result of errors of attribution, in which perceived charac­
teristics or motivations of patients, family members, or members of 
the medical evaluation team are given undue weight in the diagnostic 
formulation. These factors can influence the affective state of the clini­
cian and the integrity of cognition, increasing the likelihood of error. 
Examples of attribution-­related errors are listed in Table 1.4.
Cognitive bias may also be a product of the context in which a diag­
nostic evaluation takes place. With context-­related biases, the setting 
of the diagnostic evaluation influences how clinicians perceive and 
process the information used in medical decision-­making. External 
factors such as an increased patient volume, higher patient acuity, or 
staffing shortages, as well as internal factors such as sleep deprivation, 
stress, and physician burnout, can amplify individual cognitive bur­
den and increase the likelihood of diagnostic error. Independent of 
cognitive burden, context can introduce bias by causing physicians to 
consciously or subconsciously de-­emphasize relevant information and 
amplify impertinent information while formulating a diagnosis. Most 
common among context-­related biases is the framing effect, in which 
the manner or setting of a patient’s presentation implicitly restricts the 
breadth of differential diagnoses considered. This framing effect is often 
more prominent in contexts where patient handoffs occur frequently 
and diagnostic labels can take on an independent momentum, leaving 
little opportunity for physicians to challenge their appropriateness, or 
in specialty care settings, where patient symptoms are more likely to be 
considered primarily within the scope of that specialty’s pathophysio­
logic mechanisms. Specialty-­specific settings may also increase the risk 
of availability bias, in which familiar and more frequently encountered 
diagnoses are more readily recalled and are given greater weight in the 
differential diagnosis. When framing effects and availability heuristics 
are invoked early, they may perpetuate anchoring biases and result in a 
diagnostic momentum that precludes consideration of alternate diag­
noses, producing both erroneous diagnoses and significant delays in 
proper diagnosis. Further examples of context-­related biases are listed 
in Table 1.5.
The Well-­Calibrated Diagnostician
Effective diagnosis extends beyond applying factual recall to the infor­
mation gathered from a standardized medical history and instead 
requires the integration of experiential knowledge with individualized 
information derived from the patient, family, members of the care 
team, and diagnostic testing to develop diagnostic considerations based 
on evidence. The general challenge is being able to access information 
quickly, at the appropriate time, and in a manner that enables seamless 
patient care. It is not uncommon that clinicians need to engage these 
more analytical diagnostic approaches while simultaneously focusing 
on and reacting to tenuous physiology in a critically ill patient. Under 
circumstances such as these, determining whether the patient warrants 
a more deliberate, analytical evaluation may be difficult. Confidence

Bias
Definition
Anchoring
Locking into a diagnosis based on initial presenting features, failing to adjust diagnostic impressions when new information becomes 
available
Confirmation bias
Looking for and accepting only evidence that confirms a diagnostic impression, rejecting or not seeking contradictory evidence
Diagnostic momentum
Perpetuating a diagnostic label over time, usually by multiple providers both within and across health care systems, despite the label 
being incomplete or inaccurate
Expertise bias/yin-­
yang out
Believing that a patient who has already undergone an extensive evaluation will have nothing more to gain from further investigations, 
despite the possibility that the disease process or diagnostic techniques may have evolved so as to allow for appropriate diagnosis
Overconfidence bias
Believing one knows more than one does, acting on incomplete information or hunches, and prioritizing opinion or authority as opposed 
to evidence
Premature closure
Accepting the first plausible diagnosis prior to obtaining confirmatory evidence or considering all available evidence; “when the diagnosis 
is made, thinking stops”
Unpacking principle
Failing to explore primary evidence or data in its entirety and subsequently failing to uncover important facts or findings, such as accept­
ing a biopsy report or imaging study report without reviewing the actual specimen or image
TABLE 1.4  Cognitive Biases Related to Errors of Attribution
Bias
Definition
Affective bias
Allowing emotions to interfere with a diagnosis, either positively or negatively; dislikes of patient types (e.g., “frequent flyers”)
Appeal to authority
Deferring to authoritative recommendations from senior, supervising, or “expert” clinicians, independent of the evidentiary support for 
such recommendations
Ascertainment bias
Maintaining preconceived expectations based on patient or disease stereotypes
Countertransference
Being influenced by positive or negative subjective feelings toward a specific patient
Outcome bias
Minimizing or overemphasizing the significance of a finding or result, often based on subjective feelings about a patient, a desired 
outcome, or personal confidence in one’s own clinical skills; the use of “slightly” to describe abnormal results
Psych-­out bias
Maintaining biases about people with presumed mental illness

SECTION 1  Symptom-Based Diagnosis 
in a proposed or working diagnosis may bias or impede consideration 
for a more appropriate diagnosis. The degree of concordance between 
diagnostic confidence and diagnostic accuracy is termed diagnostic 
calibration. Given the magnitude of this challenge, in the context of a 
busy service, be it the intensive care unit, emergency room, or routine 
office visit in the middle of a pandemic, a variety of cognitive biases 
may result in poor diagnostic calibration, as a result of either bias-­
induced overconfidence or cognitive burden–related complacency, in 
which a clinician may be aware of the possibility of diagnostic error but 
underestimates or trivializes its frequency or impact. One mechanism 
to avoid such diagnostic errors is the diagnostic timeout. When the 
natural history or progression of an illness fails to conform to the orig­
inal diagnosis, or when new physical examination, laboratory, or imag­
ing findings contradict that diagnosis or suggest alternate diagnoses, 
the entire diagnostic formulation must be re-evaluated without being 
anchored to the original and possibly wrong diagnosis (Table 1.6).
These biases may interfere with the ability to recognize when a 
patient’s physiology or response to treatment fails to support the 
proposed diagnosis, such as when a child with known asthma does not 
respond to bronchodilation in the treatment room and aspiration of a 
foreign body is not considered, or when difficulty ventilating indicates 
interstitial lung disease or surfactant protein deficiency as opposed to 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia in a neonate. Revisiting the initial work­
ing diagnosis and reassessing when these red flags indicate a parallel 
diagnosis is an essential part of nurturing the skills required to being a 
well-­calibrated diagnostician.

Diagnosis most often begins with a symptom and is a complex, iter­
ative, and collaborative process. Despite the incorporation of evi­
dence-based tools, the risk of diagnostic error is always present and 
most often results from cognitive biases that can lead the clinician 
to de-­emphasize relevant clinical information or overemphasize 
impertinent findings. The path from symptom to diagnosis is rarely 
straightforward, and it is improved by building strong relationships 
with patients, employing a team-­based approach whenever possible, 
and being aware of the cognitive biases that can increase the risk of 
diagnostic error. Clinicians should also be aware of and consider 
rarer disorders that may mimic more common diseases, as well as 
atypical, variable, or slowly evolving presentations of common dis­
eases (chameleons). When presentations are complex or confounding, 
pausing the diagnostic process to engage more deliberate analytical 
approaches is warranted. One must always consider the complexity 
of the diagnostic process and emphasize the importance of develop­
ing a differential diagnosis that includes common disorders, atypical 
presentations, imitative mimics, and rare zebras.

TABLE 1.5  Cognitive Biases Related to Errors of Context
Bias
Definition
Availability bias
Basing decisions on the most recent patient with similar symptoms, preferentially recalling recent and more common diseases
Base-­rate neglect
Over-­ or underestimating the prevalence of a disease, typically overestimating the prevalence of common diseases and underestimat­
ing the prevalence of rare diseases
Framing effect
Being influenced by how or by whom a problem is described, or by the setting in which the evaluation takes place
Frequency bias
Believing that common things happen commonly and are usually benign in general practice
Hindsight bias
Reinforcing diagnostic errors once a diagnosis is discovered in spite of these errors; may lead to clinicians overestimating the efficacy 
of their clinical reasoning and may reinforce ineffective techniques
Posterior probability error
Considering the likelihood of a particular diagnosis in light of a patient’s prior or chronic illnesses (new headaches in a patient with a 
history of migraines may in fact be a tumor)
Representative bias
Basing decisions on an expected typical presentation; not effective for atypical presentations; overemphasis on disease diagnostic 
criteria or “classic” presentations; “looks like a duck, quacks like a duck”
Sutton’s slip
Ignoring alternate explanations for “obvious” diagnoses (Sutton’s law is that one should first consider the obvious)
Thinking in silo
Restricting diagnostic considerations to a particular specialty or organ system; each discipline has a set of diseases within its comfort 
zone, which reduces diagnostic flexibility or team-­based communication
Zebra retreat
Lacking conviction to pursue rare disorders even when suggested by evidence
