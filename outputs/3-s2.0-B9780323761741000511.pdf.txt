Hemostasis is a process that maintains normal blood flow through 
healthy vessels but, when a vessel is damaged, rapidly generates a 
platelet plug (primary hemostasis) and subsequent thrombin clot 
(secondary hemostasis) at the site of vascular injury. The major com­
ponents of the hemostatic mechanism are the platelets, the anticoagu­
lant proteins, the procoagulant proteins, and the various components 
of the vascular wall. Normal hemostasis is an interactive process in 
which each element cooperates closely to generate a rapid, cohesive, 
focused reaction. An abnormality of one element destabilizes the sys­
tem, but significant clinical symptoms often manifest only when two 
components are affected. Typical examples include the patient with 
hemophilia who bleeds after sustaining trauma and the antithrombin 
(AT)-­deficient woman in whom thrombosis develops during preg­
nancy. The astute clinician is aware of situations that may exacerbate 
preexisting conditions. Pretreatment of known predisposing condi­
tions can prevent complications, as exemplified by infusion of factor 
VIII (factor 8*) concentrate before and after surgery to a patient with 
hemophilia A to prevent excessive bleeding. Table 51.1 shows common 
bleeding symptoms and the most common disorders that trigger these 
symptoms.
COAGULATION CASCADE
Two opposing systems generate local clots but limit the clot to the 
area of vascular damage. Fig. 51.1 shows the sequence of activation of 
coagulation. The cascade is capable of rapid response because genera­
tion of a small number of activated factors at the “top” of the cascade 
leads to thousands of molecules of thrombin (factor 2). Deficiencies 
of proteins at or below factors 11 or 7 in the coagulation cascade 
sequence result in clinical bleeding symptoms, whereas deficiencies 
of factor 12, prekallikrein, and high-­molecular-­weight kininogen do 
not. The coagulation mechanism is continuously generating a small 
amount of thrombin. If there is trauma, tissue factor (TF) and factor 
7 combine to activate factor 10 to factor 10a both directly and indi­
rectly via factor 9. Factor 10a then forms a complex on a membrane 
surface (provided by the activated platelet) with factor 5 and calcium, 
resulting in even more thrombin generation. Platelets adhere to 
exposed subendothelial material in areas of vessel injury, thus gen­
erally restricting thrombin generation and clot formation to the area 
of damage.
Thrombin exerts positive feedback on the system by acting on fac­
tor 11 to trigger the intrinsic system, cleaving factors 5 and 8 to activate

by their respective Roman numerals. However, for this general pedi­
atrics textbook, we have chosen here to use Arabic numerals to avoid 
confusion that results on occasion from use of Roman numerals.
them, further accelerating thrombin generation, aggregating platelets, 
and activating factor 13. Clotting proteins, along with enzymes and 
zymogens, circulate in concert and a rapid activation cascade ensues 
with the exposure to damaged endothelium. This dynamic system 
concept allows for expeditious cessation of bleeding but underscores 
the impact of deficiencies in anticoagulant protein when thrombin is 
being continuously generated. A deficiency of an inhibitory enzyme 
or a cofactor removes part of the “brakes” on the system and causes 
increased thrombin generation.
COAGULATION INHIBITORS
Four key systems interact to inhibit the coagulation mechanism:
 • AT
 • Protein C/S system
 • Fibrinolytic system
 • Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)
Antithrombin
AT is a member of the serine protease inhibitor family (serpins) that 
inhibits thrombin, factor 10a, and, less efficiently, factors 9a and 11a. 
When AT is bound to heparin, this reaction is accelerated 1,000-­fold. 
AT is the active anticoagulant operative during heparin therapy; if AT 
is deficient, the activity of heparin is compromised. Heparin-­like mol­
ecules are synthesized by endothelial cells and interact with AT on the 
vessel wall to inhibit coagulation. Both congenital and acquired AT 
deficiencies are associated with a predisposition toward thrombosis. 
AT is consumed during clotting.
Protein C/Protein S System
The protein C (PC)/protein S (PS) system is complex and limits clot 
extension by inactivating the rate-­limiting coenzymes of the coagu­
lation cascade, factors 5 and 8. To prevent extension of the clot, the 
anticoagulant mechanism must limit thrombin formation to areas of 
vascular damage. First, thrombin binds to the protein thrombomod­
ulin on intact endothelial cells. Thrombomodulin-­bound thrombin 
then converts protein C into its activated form, activated protein C 
(APC). APC then combines with protein S to inactivate factors 5 and 
8. In addition, APC may promote fibrinolysis. Thrombin itself is inacti­
vated when bound to thrombomodulin and simultaneously augments 
the anticoagulant response by generating APC. APC limits the amount 
of thrombin that can be generated subsequently.
AT, PC, and PS are important inhibitors of clotting because defi­
ciencies of each of these proteins, either inherited or acquired, are asso­
ciated with an increased risk for thrombosis. A gene variant in factor 
5 (factor 5 Leiden) that makes it less susceptible to proteolysis by APC 
(resistance to APC) is the most common hereditary predisposition to

thrombosis, although it imparts only a modest increase in absolute 
risk. TFPI is an inhibitor of factor 7a (Fig. 51.2).
Fibrinolytic System
The fibrinolytic system dissolves and removes clots from the vascular 
system so that normal flow through vessels can be restored. Endothelial 
cells synthesize two activators of plasminogen: tissue-­type plasmino­
gen activator (tPA) and urokinase, both of which convert plasminogen 
to plasmin, the enzyme that degrades fibrin. Normally, plasminogen 
activator and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-­I), are 
synthesized in equimolar amounts and are released from endothelial 
cells in parallel, leading to minimal amounts of active fibrinolysis. 
Increased activation or damage to the vascular system can alter this 
balance, however, and result in increased tPA release, thus generating 
plasmin and lysing local clots. Plasminogen activator has been synthe­
sized in a recombinant form (rtPA) and is an effective pharmacologic 
fibrinolytic agent in vivo.
PLATELET-­ENDOTHELIAL CELLS AXIS
Clotting is initiated when platelets adhere to damaged endothelium 
(Fig. 51.3). In areas of vascular damage, the adhesive protein, von Wil­
lebrand factor (VWF), binds to the exposed subendothelial collagen 
matrix and undergoes a conformational change. VWF then binds to 
its platelet receptor, glycoprotein Ib, and activates platelets. Activated 
platelets secrete adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which induces nearby 
circulating platelets to aggregate. Platelet-­to-­platelet cohesion is medi­
ated by the binding of fibrinogen (clotting factor 1) to its platelet recep­
tor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (αiibβ3). Therefore, both VWF and fibrinogen 
play essential roles in normal platelet function in vivo. Simultaneously 
with the platelet adhesion-­aggregation response, coagulation is being 
activated. The phospholipid-­rich platelet membrane brings the reac­
tants of the cascade into close proximity, promoting rapid, effective fac­
tor catalysis and accelerating the reactions 1,000-­fold faster than would 
occur in the absence of the appropriate surface.
Normally, endothelial cells provide an antithrombotic surface 
through which blood flows without interruption. The endothelial cell 
is capable of a rapid change in function and character so that it can aug­
ment coagulation after stimulation with a variety of modulating agents, 
including lymphokines and cytokines, as well as noxious agents such 
as endotoxin and infectious viruses (Fig. 51.4). Widespread alteration 
of endothelial cell function can shift and disregulate the hemostatic 
response and promote activation of clotting, which is the probable 
mechanism by which sepsis induces the clinical syndrome of dissemi­
nated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
DEVELOPMENTAL HEMOSTASIS
Hemostatic disorders in newborns are more common than at any other 
pediatric age. The neonate is relatively deficient in most procoagulant 
and anticoagulant proteins. Platelet function may also be impaired. 
Blood flow characteristics in the newborn are unique because of the 
high hematocrit, small-­caliber vessels, low blood pressure, and special 
areas of vascular fragility. Table 51.2 presents the normal values for 
coagulation screening tests and procoagulant proteins in preterm and 
full-­term infants, as well as in older children. Table 51.3 presents age-­
specific values for the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic proteins.
Levels of factors 5 and 8, fibrinogen, VWF, and platelets become 
normal by 28 weeks of gestation. PS levels are also close to normal 
at birth, but levels of other anticoagulant proteins, especially PC, AT, 
and plasminogen, are low in full-­term infants and are even lower in

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
premature neonates. The levels of most procoagulant and anticoagu­
lant proteins increase throughout gestation; therefore, the most imma­
ture infant has the lowest levels of these proteins and is at the highest 
risk for either bleeding or thrombotic complications.
Vitamin K deficiency is a particular problem of the newborn. Vita­
min K is a fat-­soluble vitamin that induces the post-­translational γ-­
carboxylation of the vitamin K–dependent substances (factors 2, 7, 9, 
and 10; PC; and PS). This carboxylation step occurs after the protein 
is synthesized in the liver and must occur for a vitamin K–dependent 
coagulation factor to bind calcium, the bridge to the membrane sur­
face on which these proteins form complexes with other members of 
the clotting cascade and catalyze subsequent reactions. Vitamin K defi­
ciency effectively renders these proteins unable to bind to a surface. 
Most of the vitamin K in adults originates from the diet and from bac­
terial production in the intestine. The breast-­fed neonate is at high risk 
for vitamin K deficiency because human milk is relatively deficient in 
vitamin K, the neonatal liver itself is immature with reduced carboxyl­
ation function, and the newborn’s gut requires several days to develop 
normal bacterial flora.
Severe vitamin K deficiency in neonates, vitamin K–dependent 
bleeding (VKDB), occurs in breast-­fed infants who have not received 
intramuscular vitamin K prophylaxis. VKDB can be classified by age 
of onset into early (<24 hours), classical (days 1–7), and late (>1 week 
to <6 months), and by etiology into idiopathic and secondary. In sec­
ondary VKDB, in addition to breast-­feeding, other predisposing fac­
tors are apparent, such as poor intake or malabsorption of vitamin K 
(hepatobiliary disease). Such infants may experience diffuse bleeding 
and even central nervous system hemorrhage. VKDB is an extraordi­
narily rare event in the United States, occurring in <2% of live births, 
because of nearly universal neonatal administration of vitamin K. In 
the evaluation of bleeding in a newborn, the clinician should confirm 
that vitamin K has been administered. Patients with disorders of the 
gastrointestinal tract, those taking broad-­spectrum antibiotics, those 
born of mothers who received phenobarbital or phenytoin during 
pregnancy (very–early-­onset VKDB), and those with cholestasis and 
malabsorption (late-­onset VKDB) are at higher risk for vitamin K 
deficiency.
CLUES FROM HISTORY AND PHYSICAL 
EXAMINATION
History
Table 51.4 is an outline of historical questions that are important 
for the diagnosis of bleeding disorders as it is critical to obtain 
quantifiable, precise information. Easy bruising and nosebleeds are 
common in children, although the presence of large (>2 inches in 
diameter) bruises at multiple sites, prolonged nosebleeds (>15–30 
minutes), and hematoma formation are seen in up to 20–40% of 
children with a bleeding disorder. Bleeding postcircumcision should 
raise the suspicion of hemophilia, while bleeding from the umbili­
cal cord stump is associated with factor 13 deficiency. Some helpful 
questions include “What was the biggest bruise you ever had, and 
what caused it?” and “Have you ever noted little red dots (petechiae) 
on your skin?”
A personal or family history of gynecologic bleeding is often valu­
able. Menorrhagia causing iron-­deficiency anemia, bleeding after 
childbirth, or need for red blood cell transfusion or early hysterectomy 
because of bleeding is often inappropriately assumed to have anatomic 
causes (“dysfunctional uterine bleeding”). The clinician must ascertain 
the number of pads used per day, in addition to the length and fre­
quency of each menstrual cycle. If the majority of females in a fam­
ily have an underlying bleeding disorder, then that family’s “normal 
menstrual periods” may be quite abnormal. Many adolescent females 
with menorrhagia caused by an underlying bleeding disorder respond 
to oral contraceptive agents; therefore, improvement in bleeding symp­
toms after starting oral contraceptive agents does not rule out a bleeding 
disorder.
Historical information is equally important in deciding who requires 
evaluation for a predisposition to thrombosis. Virtually all pediatric 
patients in whom a blood clot develops in the absence of major vascu­
lar instrumentation, catheter placement, underlying infection, or other 
inflammatory state merit careful laboratory screening for a prothrom­
botic state (a hereditary or acquired disorder that predisposes to clot­
ting). Even in the situation of a provoked thrombosis, a detailed family 
history should be documented for early-­onset stroke; early myocardial 
infarction; and blood clots in the veins, arteries, or lungs.
Physical Examination
The most important determination is whether the patient appears 
acutely or chronically ill, including vital signs and growth parame­
ters. The nose should be examined for ulcers or anatomic bleeding 
sites, and the heart should be examined for the presence of murmurs 
(as occur in anemia and endocarditis). Joints should be examined 
for chronic arthropathy (as occurs in hemophilia) or joint laxity (as 
occurs in Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome), and the extremities are exam­
ined for thumb or radial anomalies (thrombocytopenia–absent 
radius syndrome, or Fanconi anemia). The abdomen and lymph 
nodes should be examined for the presence of hepatosplenomegaly 
and adenopathy.
The examination of the skin should include a search for pallor, 
hematomas, petechiae, ecchymoses, telangiectasias, poor wound 
healing (large or abnormal scars), lax (loose) skin, and varicose veins 
(possible deep venous thrombosis). Petechiae are pinpoint, flat, dark 
red lesions caused by capillary bleeding into the skin. Ecchymoses 
are larger lesions (bruises) that are flat and usually not palpable. 
Hematomas are accumulations of blood in the skin or deeper tissues; 
in the skin, hematomas are raised and palpable. Bruises should be 
described in detail, including whether hematomas are associated with 
bruises and whether petechiae are present. Petechiae and ecchymoses 
are usually painless. Purpura refers to any group of disorders char­
acterized by the presence of dark-­red, purplish, or brown lesions of 
the skin and mucous membranes. The discoloration is caused by the 
leakage of red blood cells from affected vessels. Purpuric lesions can 
be caused by abnormalities of the platelets, of coagulation proteins, 
or of vessel walls. Since all these lesions result from visualization of 
extravascular blood under the skin, blanching will not occur with 
manual pressure.

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
Coagulation Screening Tests
After obtaining a history and performing a physical examination, the 
clinician must determine the need for a hemostatic evaluation (Fig. 
51.5). The history is likely to be the most sensitive screening tool for 
a significant bleeding disorder, although its use in a very young child, 
especially before toddler age, is limited and attention must shift to the 
perinatal and family history. For patients with clinical clues of a coag­
ulation disorder, the initial screening studies should assess the clotting 
factors and platelet function. No set of screening tests is complete and 
capable of detecting the panorama of hemorrhagic disorders, but the 
screen should include:
 • CBC to evaluate hemoglobin and platelet count
 • Prothrombin time (PT)
 • Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
 • Functional fibrinogen level or thrombin time (TT)
 • VWF testing
If there is high suspicion for an underlying bleeding disorder, spe­
cific screening for von Willebrand disease (VWD) and platelet func­
tion defects should be considered even if the PT and PTT are normal. 
There are no simple tests to screen for a thrombotic tendency.
Prothrombin Time and Partial Thromboplastin Time
The PT and PTT (Fig. 51.6) are measures of all the coagulation fac­
tors except factor 13. Fibrinogen function should be measured as 
fibrinogen activity or TT. The PTT is the screening test that checks 
for deficiency of all clotting factors except factors 7 and 13. The 
PTT can be prolonged either by a deficiency of a clotting factor or 
by the presence of an agent in the plasma that delays the clotting 
time (an inhibitor). The PT is especially sensitive to deficiencies of 
factor 7.
To test for an inhibitor, one part of the patient’s plasma is mixed 
with one part of pooled normal plasma obtained from 20–50 healthy 
adults. Pooled normal plasma provides a 100% level of each clotting 
factor. If mixed 1:1 with plasma that is deficient in one or several fac­
tors, the mixture should possess at least a 50% level of each factor and 
the PTT should correct to the normal range. If an inhibitor is present, 
the PTT usually does not correct to normal. The most common types 
of inhibitors include anticoagulants, such as heparin, and autoanti­
bodies directed against either specific clotting factors (factor 8 inhib­
itors) or the phospholipid substances used in the PTT (lupus-­type 
anticoagulants).
The PTT is especially sensitive to deficiencies of factors 8, 9, and 11 
(hemophilia A, B, and C, respectively), as well as 12. A prolonged PTT 
in an asymptomatic child is most commonly caused by factor 12 defi­
ciency or by a lupus-­type anticoagulant, neither of which cause clini­
cally significant coagulopathy. The PTT can also yield a false result if 
preanalytic variables are not adequately controlled:
	1.	 When poor venipuncture technique, by adding TF to the blood, 
activates clotting and artifactually shortens the PTT
	2.	 When insensitive laboratory reagents fail to detect clinically signif­
icant deficiencies (most common in mild factor 9 deficiency)
	3.	 When the citrate concentration is not corrected for blood with a 
high hematocrit (in neonates and in patients with cyanotic congen­
ital heart disease), leading to a prolonged PTT
Bleeding Time
The bleeding time is an indirect measure of platelet number and a 
more direct measure of platelet function, vascular integrity, and plate­
let interaction with the vascular subendothelium. As such, the bleeding 
time is usually abnormal in patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet 
function abnormalities, abnormal collagen (Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome), 
and VWD. Unfortunately, because of its insensitivity and high level of 
variability, the bleeding time is a relatively poor tool for detecting the 
milder forms of these hemostatic disorders and cannot be used to rule 
out VWD and mild or moderate platelet function deficits. It is rarely 
used in the United States.

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
Platelet Function Analysis
The sensitivity and specificity of platelet function analysis are insuffi­
cient for diagnosis, but it may have utility as a screen for severe platelet 
function defects in very small infants where rapid results are needed 
and size prohibits collection of large volumes of blood needed for plate­
let aggregation testing.
Figs. 51.7 and 51.8 provide an approach to evaluate the patient with 
an isolated prolongation of the PT or PTT.
Thrombin Time and Reptilase Time
The TT and reptilase time are tests that measure the conversion of fibrin­
ogen to fibrin. The thrombin time is sensitive to heparin effect, whereas 
the snake venom reptilase time remains normal in the presence of hepa­
rin. Both the thrombin time and the reptilase time are prolonged by ure­
mia, by dysfibrinogenemia, and by low fibrinogen levels (<75 mg/dL).
MUCOCUTANEOUS BLEEDING
Mucocutaneous bleeding occurs within the skin or mucous mem­
branes. Common complaints include prolonged, frequent nosebleeds; 
gum bleeding; prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction; menorrhagia; 
and easy bruising with or without petechiae formation. Mucocutane­
ous bleeding is usually associated with abnormalities of platelet num­
ber or function, of platelet cofactors such as VWF, or of the vessel wall. 
The well-­appearing child who presents with the acute onset of pete­
chiae and purpura, often in association with nosebleeds or bleeding 
gums, and otherwise normal examination findings typically has acute 
immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The majority of affected 
children have an antecedent viral illness. After exposure to the viral 
infection, an antibody that binds to the platelet membrane develops, 
leading to the premature destruction of the antibody-­coated platelets 
in the spleen.
The peak ages for the presentation of ITP are 1–4 years of age and 
adolescence, but ITP occurs throughout childhood and adolescence. 
Females are more commonly affected in adolescence but not in child­
hood, likely due to menarche occurring in the interim. The work-­up of 
a child with thrombocytopenia should include a careful history aimed 
at detecting symptoms (e.g., weight loss, fever, bone pain, anorexia) of 
other pre-­existing illnesses (e.g., leukemia, systemic lupus erythema­
tosus [SLE], endocarditis, HIV), exposures to drugs or toxins, and a 
personal or family history of thrombocytopenia. The physical exam­
ination must be detailed and include a search for signs of malignancy 
(e.g., lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly), chronic illness, and 
congenital malformations. When evaluating the CBC, the clinician 
should ensure that the hemoglobin, white blood cell count, differential, 
indices, and peripheral smear are normal, which would make the diag­
nosis of a hematologic malignancy or other marrow failure syndrome 
unlikely. The presence of large platelets on the smear or measured as 
a high mean platelet volume suggests accelerated thrombopoiesis and 
increased platelet destruction, consistent with ITP. The differential 
diagnosis of thrombocytopenia is noted in Table 51.5; genetic disorders 
are noted in Table 51.6.
After the presumptive diagnosis of ITP, a Coombs test may be 
considered to rule out a simultaneous autoimmune hemolytic ane­
mia. The role of studies for platelet antibodies is unclear; there are no 
data indicating that these studies are either diagnostic or prognostic 
in children. If the child is male, is young, and has a history of eczema 
or recurrent infection, immunoglobulin levels to rule out Wiskott-­
Aldrich syndrome are indicated. Platelets are also often below average 
size in this disorder. Similarly, in older children, especially girls as they 
approach adolescence, an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test to rule out 
SLE manifesting as thrombocytopenia may be considered, although it

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
is more likely to yield positive results in children with chronic ITP. HIV 
infection occasionally manifests as ITP. The diagnostic yield of bone 
marrow examination in a child with normal findings on a careful phys­
ical examination (no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly) and a 
completely normal CBC including a manual white blood cell differen­
tial, other than isolated thrombocytopenia, is negligible and therefore 
not recommended.
Once a diagnosis of ITP is made, several therapeutic options are 
available, including close observation and education. The family 
should be advised that the child must avoid activities that increase 
the risk of head injury. Treatment should be reserved for children 
at high risk for clinical bleeding (platelet count <20,000/mm3 and 
children with petechiae and mucosal hemorrhages). Some clinicians 
believe that patients with mucous membrane purpura are at higher 
risk and definitely require treatment. Treatment is not recommended 
for patients without bleeding symptoms. The major cause of mor­
tality in ITP is related to intracranial hemorrhage, which has been 
observed in fewer than 0.5–1% of patients. Table 51.7 provides a per­
spective on treatment alternatives for ITP. Options for initial therapy 
for patients in need of treatment include intravenous immunoglobu­
lin (IVIG) and prednisone, and some clinicians may consider anti-­D 
immune globulin in patients with Rh-­positive blood type. Trans­
fusion of platelets should be reserved for life-­threatening bleeding 
because transfused platelets are rapidly destroyed. Thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists have been approved for use in adults and children 
with chronic ITP with bleeding symptoms not responsive to IVIG, 
steroids, or splenectomy.
Ten to 20% of children with ITP have persistence of thrombocyto­
penia for more than 6 months (chronic ITP). These patients are more 
likely to be older (adolescent) girls or to have had an insidious onset of 
symptoms. The clinician must look carefully for predisposing causes, 
including SLE; HIV infection; autoimmune lymphoproliferative syn­
drome (ALPS); common variable immune deficiency (CVID); immune 
disregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy, X-­linked (IPEX); or 
medications. The treatment of chronic ITP is evolving and includes 
repeated doses of IVIG, prolonged steroid use, and consideration of 
rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and/or splenectomy.

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
thrombotic risk, splenectomy is limited to patients with severe, refrac­
tory chronic ITP.
Neonatal Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is common, especially in sick newborns. The dif­
ferential diagnosis of neonatal thrombocytopenia includes most of the 
causes seen in older children and a few additional specific to the new­
born (Fig. 51.9, in the shaded areas; see also Table 51.5). When eval­
uating the thrombocytopenic newborn, the physician must know the 
perinatal history including the mother’s health during this and prior 
pregnancies, history of current or previous low platelets, or children 
dying of hemorrhage. A maternal history of fever, viral infection (cyto­
megalovirus, rubella), sexually transmitted infections (syphilis, HIV), 
medications, toxemia, or collagen vascular disease (SLE) is informa­
tive. The family history should be evaluated for bleeding disorders, 
recurrent infections, or malignancies, especially in siblings, both as 
neonates and at any age.
During examination of the newborn, the most important element 
to determine is the child’s general well-­being. The examiner should 
look especially for signs of systemic illness, as well as lymphadenopa­
thy, hepatosplenomegaly, mass lesions, hemangiomas, bruits, and con­
genital anomalies, especially of the radial bones. The examiner should 
carefully evaluate the hemoglobin, the white blood cell count, and the 
differential for the presence of abnormal immature cells (blasts). Red 
blood cell structure should be examined for signs of microangiopathy. 
Small platelets (low mean platelet volume) suggest abnormal throm­
bopoiesis, whereas large platelets are found with accelerated platelet 
destruction (see Fig. 51.5). Thrombocytopenia can be caused by synthetic 
failure, sequestration, or destructive processes. The destructive processes 
are most common and are either immune or nonimmune in origin. 
Nonimmune causes of platelet consumption—for example, DIC, sep­
sis, congenital infections, or thrombotic events—are usually associ­
ated with obvious clinical findings. When evaluating the ill-­appearing 
neonate or child for thrombocytopenia, the examiner should perform 
coagulation studies to detect fibrinogen consumption (fibrinogen level, 
D-­dimer). Neonates with immune-­mediated platelet destruction usu­
ally appear healthy.
After the clinician obtains a thorough history, performs a careful 
physical examination, and evaluates the CBC, the initial step in man­
agement of the child with thrombocytopenia depends on the cause and 
severity of the thrombocytopenia. In the neonate with severe throm­
bocytopenia (platelet count <40,000/mm3) delivered vaginally, an 
ultrasound study of the head should be done to rule out intracranial 
bleeding. Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia can serve both as 
a therapeutic tool for stopping the bleeding and as a diagnostic maneu­
ver. In patients with decreased platelet synthesis, survival of transfused

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
platelets should be normal (multiple days), whereas in thrombo­
cytopenic states caused by platelet destruction, transfused platelets 
should be cleared rapidly (detected with a 1-­hour post-­transfusion 
platelet count). For this reason, platelet transfusions are usually con­
traindicated in thrombocytopenic states caused by accelerated platelet 
destruction, as in ITP and hemolytic uremic syndrome (except in the 
event of life-­threatening bleeding such as intracranial hemorrhage). 
The yield and survival of the transfused platelets should be monitored 
with serial platelet counts after transfusion.
Antibody-­mediated thrombocytopenia in the neonate is caused 
by transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that react 
with the neonate’s platelets. A mother with active ITP or a history of 
previous ITP is at risk for delivering a thrombocytopenic baby. There is 
no definitive, noninvasive method to determine the newborn’s risk of 
thrombocytopenia, although the actual risk for severe bleeding during 
delivery appears low. In contrast, children born to mothers who are 
sensitized to paternal alloantigens present on the fetal platelets have 
a higher risk for perinatal hemorrhage and symptomatic thrombo­
cytopenia. This disorder, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia 
(NAIT), is the platelet equivalent of maternal Rh isoimmunization 
and differs from Rh disease in that first-­born children are commonly 
affected. The importance of this diagnosis is that it is commonly associ­
ated with prenatal intracranial hemorrhage with a resultant high rate of 
morbidity and mortality (15%). Therefore, recognition of the diagnosis 
in the first pregnancy can have a major impact on the management 
of subsequent pregnancies. Transfusion of washed maternal platelets 
that lack the paternal alloantigen toward which the maternal antibody 
is directed will correct the platelet count and prevent further bleed­
ing. Random donor platelets are rapidly destroyed. Newborns with 
NAIT can be easily differentiated from thrombocytopenic newborns of 
mothers with ITP on the basis of the mother’s platelet count. Mothers 
with ITP are thrombocytopenic unless they have had a splenectomy. 
Mothers of infants with NAIT have normal platelet counts.
Although the initial diagnosis of NAIT is usually made by study­
ing the reaction of maternal serum against paternal platelets, prenatal 
diagnosis is performed with molecular biologic techniques to detect 
the allelic differences between the mother and the fetus by analysis of 
various fetal DNA sources. After prenatal diagnosis, treatment of the 
mother with IVIG has been shown to raise the fetal platelet count and 
prevent fetal bleeding. In addition, postnatal treatment of the neonate 
with IVIG and corticosteroids may be helpful after restoration of a nor­
mal platelet count by transfusion of washed maternal platelets. All blood 
products administered to the neonate with thrombocytopenia should be 
irradiated to prevent graft versus host disease mediated by the recipient’s 
reaction to potential rare donor lymphocytes that persist in the platelet 
product despite leukofiltration, because some patients may have a con­
genital immunodeficiency syndrome manifested by thrombocytopenia.
Child Abuse
The most common cause of remarkable bruising and bleeding with 
normal hemostatic screening studies in infancy is child abuse. Child 
abuse may mimic a bleeding disorder and it is important to obtain 
screening studies in the evaluation of potential child maltreatment.
Chronic/Insidious Onset of Mucocutaneous Bleeding
When symptoms of skin and mucous membrane bleeding are lifelong, 
the most common cause is VWD. Congenital platelet function defects 
are almost as common, while congenital thrombocytopenic syndromes 
and abnormalities of the vessel wall are less common. VWD, the defi­
ciency of VWF, is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, 
with a prevalence of approximately 1/1,000 in the milder forms. The 
inheritance of VWD is usually autosomal dominant. VWF is a large,

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
multimeric protein that functions as the bridge between platelets and 
damaged vessel walls; therefore, deficient or dysfunctional VWF causes 
delayed formation of the platelet plug (see Fig. 51.3). In addition, VWF 
serves as a carrier protein for factor 8. A profound deficiency of VWF 
is associated with low levels of factor 8, so that the patient with severe 
VWD has the clinical manifestations of both VWD and hemophilia.
The presentation of VWD is highly variable. Mucocutaneous bleed­
ing or no symptoms are the most common findings. Because neona­
tal VWF levels are often elevated after vaginal delivery, the onset of 
clinical symptoms for mild and moderate VWD is usually during the 
toddler stage or later. The only presenting complaint may be abnormal 
preoperative screening coagulation studies. The laboratory diagnosis 
of the disease is particularly challenging because there is no single test 
that optimally measures VWF function.
The PTT and bleeding time are only abnormal in about half of 
patients VWD. A von Willebrand screen, including VWF antigen (to 
measure total protein) and activity (to measure protein function) is rec­
ommended to fully assess for VWD. The need for additional work-­up is 
defined by the clinical clues, including the patient’s personal history of 
bleeding, the family history, and the potential for surgery (Fig. 51.10).
The diagnosis of VWD is further complicated by the observation 
that VWF is a labile protein and levels can be increased by stress, med­
ication, trauma, pregnancy, and difficult venipuncture. VWF levels are 
also elevated following vaginal delivery in some infants with VWD. 
This can be helpful in terms of ability to perform circumcision in some 
males with potential VWD, but problematic in terms of making an 
immediate diagnosis. It remains unclear whether there is a physiologi­
cally different hemostatic level of VWF for different blood groups. Age 
has been shown to influence VWF levels in adults, but this has not 
been adequately investigated in children. Furthermore, there are mul­
tiple variants of VWD; the clinician should perform repeated studies if 
there is a high index of suspicion or abnormal positive screening tests.
VWD can be classified as type 1 (classic disease with mild or mod­
erate quantitative deficiency), type 2 (a dysproteinemia or qualitative 
deficiency), or type 3 (severe disease: virtual absence of VWF [near-­
complete quantitative deficiency] as well as low levels of factor 8). The 
treatment of the disease is dependent on the type and the response 
to 1-­deamino(8-­d-­arginine) vasopressin (DDAVP). DDAVP is a syn­
thetic vasopressin analog that induces the release of VWF and fac­
tor 8. Levels of these factors rise three-­ to fivefold after a dose of 0.3

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
μg/kg. For most cases of VWD, DDAVP is the treatment of choice. 
A therapeutic trial with measurements of VWF before and both 1 
hour and 4 hours after DDAVP administration should be performed 
to document the efficacy of DDAVP before surgery. The late time­
point is useful to identify clearance defects, such as type 1C, which 
may demonstrate an initial response but lack the sustained response 
critical for clinical use of DDAVP. Patients with rare variant forms 
of VWD (type 2A, type 2B, and platelet type) may have no response 
or an adverse response to DDAVP; therefore, while some screening 
evaluations such as an activity-­to-­antigen ratio <0.6, for example, can 
raise suspicion for type 2 disease, full studies to identify the subtype 
are needed before a trial of DDAVP. These studies correlate functional 
levels of VWF with the amount of protein measured antigenically 
(VWF antigen), the multimeric size of the protein (VWF multimers), 
and the aggregation response of the patient’s platelet-­rich plasma to 
high and low concentrations of ristocetin or VWF binding to platelet 
GPIb (VWF activity).
Most patients with mild and moderate type 1 VWD have a satis­
factory response to intranasal or intravenous DDAVP; hemostasis for 
most surgical procedures can be provided with daily doses of DDAVP 
on consecutive days, but use beyond 3 days is not recommended due 
to limited effect after this time as endothelial stores of VWF and factor 
8 will have been exhausted. For severely affected patients or those with 
variant forms of the disease noted previously (type 2A, type 2B, platelet 
type), treatment should be individualized. Some patients with type 2A 
respond to DDAVP. Severely affected patients with VWD and those 
with the 2B variant should receive a clotting factor concentrate con­
taining a full complement of normal VWF multimers (Humate-­P and 
Wilate are the currently approved products for children, and Vonvendi 
[recombinant VWF concentrate] is approved for use in adults) in doses 
similar to those outlined for factor 8 in Table 51.8.
Platelet Function Defects
For patients with mucocutaneous bleeding but a normal platelet 
count and normal VWF studies, platelet aggregation studies should 
be performed to evaluate for a primary or secondary platelet function 
defect, especially if abnormality is detected on a screening platelet 
function assay (PFA). Many medications may induce an acquired 
abnormality of platelet number and/or function. A careful history 
to elicit exposure to medications and to determine whether clinical 
symptoms correlate with exposure to specific drugs is critical. Com­
mon medications that alter platelet number or function are aspirin, 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, alcohol, penicillin in high 
doses, and valproic acid.
Most primary platelet function defects cause relatively mild muco­
cutaneous bleeding symptoms (see Table 51.6). In these disorders, 
there is most commonly an abnormality of the storage granules or 
release mechanism within the platelet, causing delayed or diminished 
response to agonists that induce platelet aggregation, such as collagen. 
Platelet function defects, like most other hemostatic defects, are accen­
tuated by medications that impair platelet function. In rare instances, 
a patient demonstrates impressive petechiae and hematomas at birth 
because of an absence of one of the essential platelet membrane recep­
tors for the adhesive proteins VWF or fibrinogen. These disorders, 
Glanzmann thrombasthenia (deficiency of glycoprotein αIIbβ3, 
the fibrinogen receptor) and Bernard-­Soulier syndrome (deficiency 
of glycoprotein Ib, the von Willebrand receptor), represent the most 
severe types of platelet function defects. The platelet count is normal

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
in Glanzmann thrombasthenia thrombocytopenia, but patients with 
Bernard-­Soulier syndrome usually have thrombocytopenia with 
remarkably large platelets.
Milder thrombocytopenia syndromes have been well characterized 
due to advances in genetics; a defect in the myosin heavy chain 9 gene 
(MYH9) causes congenital macrothrombocytopenia, associated in 
some cases with deafness, ocular abnormalities, or nephritis. Congen­
ital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is caused by a defect in the 
thrombopoietin receptor c-­Mpl, while X-­linked thrombocytopenia is 
caused by a defect in GATA-­1. Patients with mild or moderate platelet 
function defects often respond to DDAVP (though the exact mecha­
nism of this response remains unknown), but more severe bleeding 
may necessitate platelet transfusions.
Chronic Thrombocytopenic Syndromes
Patients with long-­standing thrombocytopenia usually present with 
mucocutaneous bleeding. Mechanisms of the thrombocytopenia include 
impaired marrow synthesis, sequestration, and increased destruction 
(see Fig. 51.9). These can be acquired or congenital. The congenital 
thrombocytopenic syndromes usually manifest at the time of birth or 
early in infancy. These syndromes may be associated with congenital 
anomalies (thrombocytopenia–absent radius syndrome and Fanconi 
anemia) or be part of a complex hereditary syndrome (Wiskott-­Aldrich 
syndrome with small platelets, eczema, and immunodeficiency) in addi­
tion to thrombocytopenia. Small platelets are a frequent finding in many 
of the syndromes associated with decreased platelet production. During 
the physical examination of patients with suspected congenital thrombo­
cytopenia, the clinician must search not only for the signs of bleeding but 
also for subtle congenital anomalies, including abnormal growth param­
eters, the presence of skin hyperpigmentation or café-­au-­lait spots, and 
anomalies of the limbs, axial skeleton, and urinary tract.
The acquired causes of thrombocytopenia resulting from decreased 
production usually have an insidious onset of symptoms and are often 
associated with other abnormalities in the blood count. The aplastic syn­
dromes (congenital aplastic anemia and acquired aplastic anemia) are 
associated with the gradual onset of thrombocytopenia, usually in asso­
ciation with a falling granulocyte count and anemia. Platelets are small, 
and the mean corpuscular volume is usually elevated.
Infiltration of the marrow by malignant cells or storage cells inter­
feres with normal thrombopoiesis and commonly results in thrombo­
cytopenia. Common malignancies associated with thrombocytopenia 
include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphomas, Langerhans cell his­
tiocytosis, and metastatic solid tumors (neuroblastoma). Abnormalities 
of other blood elements, as well as findings of adenopathy, hepatospleno­
megaly, or masses, are clues to the presence of an infiltrative disorder.
Disorders of the vessel walls may present either acutely or chronically. 
Vasculitic disorders often manifest with lesions of the skin and mucous 
membranes that appear hemorrhagic and are associated with clinical 
symptoms related to involvement of other organ systems (gastrointes­
tinal, renal, central nervous system). Paradoxically, patients with these 
disorders usually have normal coagulation studies and normal platelet 
counts. Henoch-­Schönlein purpura is an example; it manifests with a 
purpuric rash, including both petechiae and larger palpable purpuric 
lesions of the lower extremities and buttocks, often found in association 
with arthritis, cramping abdominal pain, and focal glomerulonephritis.
Petechiae and ecchymoses are also common symptoms of disorders 
of the collagen matrix. Patients with Ehlers-­Danlos syndrome have lax 
joints, hyperelastic skin, and abnormal wound healing. These patients 
frequently present with ecchymoses and rarely with petechiae. Bleed­
ing time is usually prolonged, but other ex vivo hemostatic assays are 
usually normal, and so the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical 
findings and, in some cases, genetic evaluation.
DEEP BLEEDING
Bleeding into the tissues of the muscles or joints is characteristic of 
hemophilia. The presentation of the patient with hemophilia varies 
with severity, age, and exposure to trauma. Only 30% of boys with 
hemophilia bleed excessively at circumcision, and neonatal intracra­
nial bleeding is rare despite the trauma of a vaginal delivery. After the 
neonatal period, children with hemophilia usually present as toddlers 
with either intramuscular hematomas or hemarthroses. In the toddler 
stage, the most commonly affected joints are the ankles and elbows; 
the knees, hips, and shoulders are affected later. The affected children, 
who are usually boys due to the X-­linked genetic nature of this disease, 
bruise easily and hematomas frequently develop over areas of com­
mon trauma (the forehead, arms, and legs, especially pretibial). Other 
common bleeding sites include the frenulum and sites of venipuncture. 
Sites of life-­threatening bleeding include the central nervous system 
(the most common cause of death from hemorrhage); the mouth and 
throat, resulting in airway obstruction; and the retroperitoneal area or 
gastrointestinal tract, leading to exsanguination.
Red flags for the diagnosis of hemophilia are:
 • Persistent bleeding after circumcision
 • Hemarthrosis/intramuscular hematoma
 • Bleeding frenulum
The deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B) 
causes bleeding because delayed thrombin formation results in a large, 
friable clot. Often there is an initial hemostatic plug that breaks down 
hours after the injury (secondary bleeding). Because factors 8 and 9 are 
necessary for normal wound healing, patients with inadequate replace­
ment or untreated hemophilia frequently have poorly healed wounds.
Hemophilia A occurs in 1/10,000 live births and hemophilia B 
in about 1/40,000. The PTT is prolonged and should correct on 1:1 
mix with normal plasma. Specific assays for factors 8 and 9 should be

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
performed to identify the deficient factor. Severity is determined by 
the level of the deficient clotting factor. Severe hemophilia is defined 
by the World Health Organization as <1% factor activity, moderate as 
1–5% activity, and mild as >5% activity. These factor levels correlate 
approximately with clinical symptoms: Patients with severe deficiency 
bleed spontaneously; patients with moderate deficiency bleed with 
minor trauma; and patients with mild deficiency bleed only after sig­
nificant trauma, and their condition may go undiagnosed for many 
years. Because hemophilia A and B are transmitted as X-­linked traits, 
the family history may be informative if there is a history of male 
maternal relatives with a bleeding disorder. Approximately 33% of 
affected patients have new gene variants and therefore have a negative 
family history. Bleeding complications have occurred in female carri­
ers, especially at surgery; thus, all obligate carriers should have factor 
levels measured to determine if perioperative hemostasis management 
is indicated.
Treatment of hemophilia requires prompt replacement or correc­
tion of the deficient factor with the safest available material. Table 51.8 
provides dosing information and therapeutic alternatives for factors 8 
and 9 deficiency. Treatment of bleeding episodes is first aimed at stop­
ping the hemorrhage, and then should be continued until the wound 
has healed. Recombinant factor 8 or 9 concentrate is a commonly used 
treatment product, with purified plasma-­derived factor as an alterna­
tive choice with some evidence that suggests a lower risk for inhibitor 
formation in previously untreated patients with this latter approach. 
Extended half-­life factor products have been developed and may 
improve quality of life by reducing the frequency of infusions but still 
allow for peak levels that may be protective against bleeding during 
sports or other activities. A shift was seen with the approval of emi­
cizumab, a subcutaneously administered bispecific antibody therapy 
that can be administered as rarely as monthly and has been recently 
approved for use in children and adults with hemophilia A with and 
without inhibitors. This product provides a steady-­state level of a fac­
tor 8 mimetic that binds factors 9a and 10 similarly to the tenase com­
plex in the intrinsic system. For patients with mild hemophilia A who 
respond to DDAVP with adequate levels, DDAVP is the treatment of 
choice. Prophylaxis with factor concentrates has revolutionized the 
care of children with hemophilia by preventing chronic arthropathy 
and muscular atrophy. Patients with hemophilia should be monitored 
at comprehensive treatment centers that are experienced in the medi­
cal, social, physical, and financial impact of hemophilia care.
The common complications of hemophilia treatment can be divided 
into those of immunologic origin and those caused by infectious 
organisms. In 15–25% of patients with hemophilia A and a smaller 
percentage of patients with hemophilia B, inhibitors to clotting fac­
tor replacement material develop. These inhibitors, usually IgG anti­
bodies, lead to rapid inactivation and clearance of infused replacement 
material. The presence of an inhibitor should be suspected and tested 
for in any patient with hemophilia who does not respond appropri­
ately to factor replacement. The treatment of patients with inhibitors is 
problematic and should be relegated to experts in hemophilia care. The 
management of acute bleeding episodes may require administration of 
an activated clotting factor concentrate to “bypass” the inhibitor.
Infectious complications of hemophilia therapy have been cur­
tailed by donor screening, sophisticated viral inactivation processes, 
and chemical purification techniques used in the preparation of 
plasma-­derived replacement material. Recombinant factor concen­
trates represent the culmination of these efforts. Older patients treated 
before 1983 with concentrates were exposed to HIV, hepatitis C, and 
sometimes hepatitis B. Most patients exposed to HIV became infected 
and manifested the spectrum of signs and symptoms of HIV infec­
tion. Viral inactivation techniques in conjunction with intense donor 
screening for hepatitis C antibody have greatly decreased the risk for 
hepatitis C exposure. Nevertheless, chronic non-­A, non-­B hepatitis is 
a common finding in older patients with hemophilia who were treated 
with plasma-­derived factor concentrates.
The need for intravenous access to provide factor infusions creates 
another complication with the use of indwelling central venous cath­
eters to facilitate factor delivery to young children with poor venous 
access. While some patients can be treated with less frequent dosing 
through peripheral veins, some patients undergo surgery for place­
ment of a central venous catheter (CVC). Although these catheters 
undoubtedly increase adherence to prophylactic treatment, they can 
serve as a nidus for infection or thrombosis or lead to complications 
due to surgery required for insertion or removal. The complicated 
decision-­making around CVC use is one factor driving the consider­
ation of emicizumab, which does not require IV access.
A new frontier in hemophilia therapy is on the horizon with the 
development of gene therapy and gene-­editing techniques, of which 
several are currently in phase II and III clinical trials. Long-­term real-­
world safety and efficacy have yet to be shown definitively, primarily 
due to the relatively short duration of the trials to date, but there is real 
potential for a possible “cure” for hemophilia with this approach.
Surgical Bleeding
Aside from technical causes, most surgical bleeding results from a fail­
ure to recognize a pre-­existing coagulopathy. VWD and primary or 
secondary platelet dysfunction are the most common causes of bleed­
ing after ear, nose, and throat surgery. Significant hemorrhaging after 
general surgery is often a manifestation of previously undiagnosed 
mild or moderate hemophilia or vitamin K deficiency.
When elective surgery is planned, the decision to perform preopera­
tive hemostatic screening is influenced by the patient’s age (and therefore 
previous exposure to trauma), personal and family histories of bleeding, 
and type of surgery. Certain surgeries, such as tonsillectomy, scoliosis 
repair, and central nervous system surgery, provide major challenges 
to hemostasis, having a high frequency of bleeding complications. In 
contrast, most general surgical procedures, such as hernia repair, rarely 
involve clinical bleeding. The diagnostic yield of preoperative studies 
before tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy remains controversial.
GENERALIZED BLEEDING
Generalized bleeding is a manifestation of a major disorder of hemo­
stasis, usually caused by a deficiency of multiple factors in association 
with deficient or dysfunctional platelets. Generalized bleeding occurs 
most commonly in the context of DIC in seriously ill patients.
DIC is a generalized consumption of clotting factors, anticoagulant 
proteins, and platelets triggered by a life-­threatening illness and usually 
accompanied by ischemia, hypoxia, and shock (Table 51.9). DIC may 
be either a hemorrhagic or a thrombotic disorder, or both, as the clini­
cal manifestations of this generalized coagulopathy are highly variable. 
Laboratory studies usually demonstrate a prolonged PT, decreased 
fibrinogen level, and decreased platelet level (these are the most reli­
able indicators of DIC), in addition to elevated D-­dimer levels and a 
prolonged PTT.
Several mechanisms can trigger acute DIC, including widespread 
endothelial damage induced directly or indirectly by infectious organ­
isms and release of procoagulant material after trauma. Virtually any 
life-­threatening illness or injury can trigger DIC. In acute DIC, acti­
vation of the clotting mechanism leads to consumption of clotting fac­
tors (1, 2, 5, 8), anticoagulant proteins (PC, PS, AT, plasminogen), and 
platelets. In the syndrome known as purpura fulminans, microvascular 
thromboses develop in the skin, causing painful purpuric lesions that

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
progress to localized necrotic lesions. Table 51.10 presents laboratory 
findings in DIC in comparison with those in other acquired coagu­
lopathies that potentially could be confused with DIC. Because DIC is 
virtually always seen in a child with a life-­threatening illness, the clini­
cal diagnosis is usually made on the basis of the child’s clinical appear­
ance in association with laboratory abnormalities. Clotting factor and 
anticoagulant protein levels are confirmatory but seldom necessary 
to reach a diagnosis of DIC. The only diagnosis difficult to differen­
tiate from DIC in the laboratory is that of severe hepatic disease with 
impending liver failure. The patient with severe liver disease is mark­
edly jaundiced and the thrombocytopenia is relatively mild.
The treatment of DIC focuses on the underlying cause of the DIC, 
on the altered homeostasis that sustains the coagulopathy, and on the 
bleeding or thrombotic complications that ensue. Shock itself plays 
a critical role in DIC because shock reduces the reticuloendothelial 
clearance of activated clotting factors and complexes. Reduced hepatic 
blood flow causes decreased synthesis of depleted clotting and antico­
agulant proteins.
To summarize the treatment of DIC:
	1.	 Treat the initiating and propagating events.
	2.	 Optimize cardiorespiratory status by improving perfusion and cor­
recting acidosis.

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
	3.	 Replace deficient platelets, clotting factors, and anticoagulant pro­
teins (Table 51.11) if needed. Specific indications for replacement 
are variable and depend on the patient’s clinical condition and 
severity of bleeding.
The following are rough guidelines for treatment:
 • Fresh-­frozen plasma, 10–15 mL/kg every 6–12 hours, to provide 
clotting factors in physiologic balance with anticoagulant proteins
 • Platelets, ½–1 single donor apheresis unit for platelet count 
<50,000/mm3
 • Cryoprecipitate, 1 bag/5 kg for fibrinogen level <100 mg/dL
 • Prothrombin complex concentrate (indicated for urgent reversal of 
acquired coagulation factor defect from vitamin K antagonist ther­
apy in adults), dosing based on pretreatment international normal­
ized ratio (INR)
 • Anticoagulant therapy for major vessel thrombosis
The efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in DIC has not been proved in 
controlled prospective studies. Heparin has been used for the treatment 
of purpura fulminans, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and thromboses 
that develop in conjunction with DIC. Most patients with DIC have a 
coagulopathy that consumes procoagulant proteins and causes clinical 
oozing or bleeding; in a small percentage of patients, however, throm­
bosis develops. In these patients, anticoagulant therapy may decrease 
morbidity and should be considered for administration in a manner 
similar to that for those patients who have major vascular thrombosis 
(Table 51.12), though the risk assessment evaluations as well as type 
and dose of anticoagulant for thromboprophylaxis in children is cur­
rently an area of intense study. Deficient clotting factors and platelets 
should be transfused to prevent further development of thrombosis or 
bleeding during anticoagulation.
Neonatal Purpura Fulminans
The differential diagnosis of a neonate who presents with multiple 
purpuric lesions over the buttocks, trunk, extremities, and face (nose, 
ears) that change from dark red to purple and black over a few min­
utes in association with abnormal neurologic findings or an abdominal 
mass includes sepsis with DIC and a generalized viral infection. A key 
finding in such a neonate for a homozygous PC deficiency is the pres­
ence of painful petechiae and purpura (purpura fulminans). After viral 
and bacterial cultures, diagnostic studies should include a CBC and 
coagulation screening for DIC, as well as measurements of PC, PS, AT, 
and plasminogen.
To confirm this diagnosis, the clinician must differentiate DIC from 
congenital PC deficiency. DIC is characterized by the consumption of 
clotting factors, anticoagulant proteins, and platelets. Although PC lev­
els fall in DIC, patients with congenital PC deficiency have strikingly 
low levels of PC. Anticoagulant proteins are routinely consumed in sit­
uations of widespread activation of the clotting mechanism. Therefore, 
mildly depressed levels of PS, AT, and plasminogen would be expected 
when there is generalized intravascular coagulation. In congenital PC 
deficiency, the PC level is strikingly lower than that of the other anti­
coagulant proteins, which increases the likelihood that the deficiency 
of PC represents the primary cause of the coagulopathy. To determine 
whether the deficiency is hereditary, the next step is to obtain blood 
samples from the parents to measure levels of the deficient protein or 
proteins. In homozygous deficiencies, the levels of both parents should 
be reduced. Deficiency of PC, PS, or AT usually manifests as venous 
thromboembolic disease in adulthood and is inherited as a codominant 
trait. Congenital severe, symptomatic PC deficiency is usually inher­
ited in an autosomal recessive manner from asymptomatic parents.
Therapy must be instituted promptly to replace the deficient antico­
agulant protein with fresh frozen plasma. Fresh frozen plasma contains 
all of the clotting factors and anticoagulant proteins in an unconcen­
trated form. PC has a short half-­life and may need to be infused every 
6–12 hours to maintain measurable levels. This, unfortunately, may 
lead to problems with fluid and protein overload if repeated doses of 
plasma are necessary. PC concentrate is now available as specific ther­
apy for patients with PC deficiency. The patient should also undergo 
anticoagulation with heparin to limit further thromboses. A striking 
improvement after administration of PC, either as plasma or as con­
centrate, is strong evidence of the diagnosis. Warfarin therapy has been 
effective in managing such patients on a chronic basis.
Other Causes of Generalized Bleeding
A coagulopathy is a common complication of severe liver disease with 
synthetic dysfunction, resulting from deficient production of mul­
tiple clotting factors and anticoagulant proteins in association with 
increased D-­dimer formed as a result of hyperfibrinolysis. This may 
contribute to inhibition of platelet function.

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
Uremia results in a diffuse bleeding diathesis, with mucosal bleeding 
(epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding) as a major manifestation. The major 
underlying mechanism in uremic bleeding appears to be increased nitric 
oxide generation, leading to decreased platelet function. Many patients 
with bleeding caused by uremia or liver disease respond to DDAVP.
Vitamin K deficiency manifests as generalized bleeding into the 
skin, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. Children at 
highest risk are breast-­fed neonates, malnourished individuals, those 
receiving broad-­spectrum antibiotics, those with cholestatic liver dis­
ease and subsequent vitamin K malabsorption, and those who have 
ingested rat poison (warfarin). The treatment of patients with vitamin 
K deficiency is parenteral vitamin K. The response is usually rapid, but 
in emergency situations, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma corrects 
the coagulopathy faster. Differentiation of some of these syndromes 
from DIC is presented in Table 51.10.
THROMBOSIS
Thromboembolic disease in pediatrics has a bimodal age distribution. 
Venous and arterial thrombi are common in newborns, especially in 
premature neonates, because of the combination of low levels of anti­
coagulant proteins, decreased blood flow, elevated blood viscosity 
because of high hematocrit, and, in particular, the placement of intra­
vascular catheters for monitoring and nutrition. The second peak of 
thromboembolic disease, usually venous in character, is in adolescence, 
when patients with primary deficiencies of anticoagulant proteins typi­
cally present and when secondary disorders (e.g., vasculitis, pregnancy, 
malignancy, surgery, major trauma, inflammatory bowel disease, and 
infection) induce a higher frequency of venous thrombosis.
Venous Thromboembolic Disease
Diagnostic Approach
Venous thromboembolic disease classically manifests with a warm, 
swollen, tender extremity or affected organ. The differential diagnosis 
in such cases includes trauma, infection, stasis without thrombosis, 
lymphedema, edema, and neoplasm. In children and adolescents, 
thrombi may develop within major internal organs with distinctive 
clinical manifestations, including sagittal sinus thrombosis with resul­
tant increased intracranial pressure; hepatic vein thrombosis with 
the Budd-­Chiari syndrome; portal vein thrombosis associated with 
splenomegaly and varices; and renal vein thrombosis with a resul­
tant abdominal mass, hematuria, and proteinuria. Long-­term central 
venous access is associated with a significant risk for asymptomatic 
venous thrombosis. Pulmonary emboli may manifest as “atypical” 
pneumonia resulting in chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, short­
ness of breath, and/or hypoxemia in the absence of fever. The hypox­
emia may occur in the presence of minimal findings on routine chest 
radiographs.
The clinician should obtain a careful history for antecedent trauma, 
infection, or other predisposing causes of thromboembolic disease 
(Table 51.13). The abdomen and extremities should be carefully exam­
ined for mass lesions leading to venous stasis. The presence of a bruit or 
hemihypertrophy of the affected limb is a clue to an arteriovenous mal­
formation. In addition, masses within the bone, abdominal tumors, and 
lymphatic obstruction should be considered. Initial laboratory studies 
should include a CBC, platelet count, and evaluation for DIC, as well 
as cultures of the blood if the patient is febrile. During the process of 
a localized thrombosis, there may be consumption of clotting factors, 
but rarely is the consumption significant enough in older children and 
adults to induce abnormal results on routine coagulation screening 
tests (platelets, PT, PTT, fibrinogen). Tests for fibrin breakdown (D-­di­
mer) may be positive. Unfortunately, these tests are nonspecific and not 
necessarily diagnostic of vascular thrombosis. Studies in adults have 
indicated that lack of elevated D-­dimer has a strong negative predic­
tive value for pulmonary embolus, especially when combined with a 
clinical algorithm for risk assignment such as the Wells criteria (Table 
51.14). The diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected venous 
thrombosis is presented in Fig. 51.11.

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
Specific Diagnostic Studies
Compression ultrasonography is generally used to assess for the pres­
ence of a lower extremity thrombosis and many episodes of upper 
extremity thrombosis. While ultrasound with Doppler flow studies to 
look at flow of red blood cells through arteries or veins may be suffi­
cient for diagnosis of renal or hepatic thrombosis as well, consideration 
should be given to other modalities, including CT scan, echocardio­
gram, and venography. MRI and magnetic resonance venography can 
be useful in diagnosis of venous dural sinus thrombosis or evaluation 
of proximal extent of a lower extremity into the large vessels of the 
pelvis and/or abdomen.

CHAPTER 51  Bleeding and Thrombosis
If pulmonary embolism is suspected, a spiral CT scan is the diag­
nostic study of choice. CT scan is indicated in any patient with a venous 
thrombosis and cardiac and/or respiratory symptoms, including tachy­
cardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Pulmonary embolism may be present 
without significant respiratory distress and should be considered in 
patients with chest pain or hemoptysis, particularly following surgery 
and immobilization.
Thrombophilia Testing
In children, the diagnosis of venous thrombosis in the setting of risk 
factors, such as surgery, immobilization, or catheter placement, does 
not generally warrant any additional work-­up. Adult guidelines spe­
cifically recommend against thrombophilia testing in thrombosis in 
the setting of major transient risk factors. An unprovoked, or recurrent, 
thrombosis merits work-­up for a congenital or acquired thrombophilic 
condition. Some clinicians may also pursue this work-­up for thrombi 
in unusual anatomic sites, with extremely large thrombus burden, or in 
patients with family history of thrombosis.
The most severe inherited thrombophilias are deficiencies of anti­
coagulants PC, PS, and AT. Although rare, these are associated with 
a higher relative risk for thrombosis than the more common throm­
bophilias. Levels of PC, AT, and plasminogen may be depleted/con­
sumed after development of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, 
or both; low levels at the time of thrombosis do not necessarily imply a 
congenital deficiency. If low levels are found, consideration should be 
given to performing studies on the parents to establish the inheritance 
of the deficiency because all these are inherited as autosomal codom­
inant traits. Alternatively, or in addition, the patient’s levels should be 
re-­evaluated several months after the acute event; the clinician should 
remember that warfarin reduces functional levels of all the vitamin K–
dependent proteins, including PC and PS.
Less severe, but more common, inherited thrombophilias include 
factor 5 Leiden and the prothrombin gene variant. These occur in up 
to 5% of the U.S. population and have a lower relative risk for thrombo­
sis. Testing of asymptomatic family members is not generally required, 
although affected females should probably be counseled to avoid estrogen-­
containing oral contraceptives due to a higher risk for thrombosis.
The lupus anticoagulant (LA) is one of several antiphospholipid 
antibodies (others including anticardiolipin and β-­2-­glycoprotein-­Ib 
antibodies) that acts as an acquired thrombophilia. This causes a pro­
longed PTT that fails to correct on mixing with normal plasma because 
of the presence of an antibody that reacts with the phospholipid reagent 
in the PTT. The lupus anticoagulant does not bind in vivo to the platelet 
membrane; thus, the whole blood clotting time is normal. Paradox­
ically (considering the name), the LA is associated with venous and 
arterial thromboembolic disease and spontaneous abortions but is usu­
ally not a cause of clinical bleeding. If these study findings are negative, 
the thrombin time should be measured or a comparison of functional 
and antigenic levels of fibrinogen should be done to detect a dysfibrin­
ogenemia. The presence of an LA occurs frequently in patients with 
SLE, but it is by no means exclusive to this disease. Indeed, approxi­
mately 5% of healthy children may develop transient, self-­resolving LA 
after infection, trauma, or surgery.
Arterial Thrombosis
Arterial thrombi are rare in older children and adolescents and are 
frequently a manifestation of a systemic disorder resulting in vascular 
damage or embolic disease such as sickle cell anemia, Kawasaki dis­
ease, bacterial endocarditis, vasculitis syndromes, homocystinuria, 
or cocaine use. The presence of an intraarterial catheter is an obvi­
ous nidus for thrombosis. Neck trauma that is often mild can cause 
carotid or vertebral artery dissection or aneurysms. These dissections 
or aneurysms can result in emboli to the brain. A history of neck 
trauma should be sought in older children who present with arterial 
stroke.
ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY
Parenteral Therapy
Unfractionated Heparin
Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the most commonly used agent for 
the initial treatment of venous or arterial thrombosis and is adminis­
tered either intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously. Heparin functions 
as an anticoagulant by binding to AT and accelerating the AT-­
dependent inactivation of thrombin and factor 10a, as well as of fac­
tors 9a and 11a. Although most studies of heparin pharmacokinetics 
have been performed in adults, there are important differences in the 
pharmacologic features of heparin in children and especially neo­
nates. Thirty-­nine percent of children achieve a prolongation of the 
PTT within the target range after a bolus dose of 50 U/kg. Children 
younger than 1 year require an average of 28 U/kg/hr to maintain a 
therapeutic level of the PTT. In contrast, most children older than 1 
year are satisfactorily maintained on 20 U/kg/hr of heparin. A rep­
resentative treatment protocol may begin with an initial IV bolus of 
50–75 U/kg of heparin, with 20–25 U/kg/hr for a minimum of 5 days 
to maintain a PTT of approximately 2–2.5 times the control value. 
Reports in adults suggest that the heparin level (UFH-­calibrated 
anti-­Xa assay) is superior for monitoring heparin therapy compared 
to the PTT. The heparin level or PTT should be checked every 4–6 
hours after a dose change until a satisfactory level is attained, and 
then at least every 6 hours after that. Studies have documented an 
increased risk for progressive or recurrent thrombi in patients who 
fail to achieve adequate anticoagulant levels promptly. Sometimes 
this delay can be seen in patients with concomitant bleeding con­
cerns that preclude the use of an up-­front bolus, or those with sig­
nificant clinical inflammation that may increase levels of circulating 
heparin-­binding proteins. Anti-­Xa levels are especially useful in pre­
mature and full-­term newborns who may have a “normal” prolonged 
PTT. A therapeutic range of 0.3–0.7 U/dL has been demonstrated to 
be safe and effective.
Low-­molecular-­weight heparin (LMWH) provides an alternative 
to standard UFH therapy. Pediatric experience with LMWH given 
subcutaneously is similar to that in adults. LMWH given to infants 
and children with thromboses appears to be as effective as standard 
heparin, with a similar or reduced risk for bleeding. LMWH requires 
much less laboratory monitoring. Reasonable age-­based starting 
doses of the LMWH enoxaparin in pediatrics are approximately 1.75 
mg/kg (for patients younger than 1 month), 1.64 mg/kg (1 month to 
1 year), 1.5 mg/kg (1 to 6 years), and 1.0 mg/kg (older than 6 years 
of age). Similar to UFH, a LMWH-­calibrated anti-­Xa assay can be 
used to adjust dosing as needed to achieve a level between 0.5 and 
1.0 U/dL. Dalteparin, another LMWH, is the only other anticoagu­
lant approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as of this 
writing.
Total length of therapy for provoked clots typically extends for 
3 months, while therapy for unprovoked clots may extend to 6–12 
months or even indefinitely, depending on the presence of other pro­
thrombotic conditions and personal/family thrombotic history.
Heparin and LMWH may induce thrombocytopenia (heparin-­
induced thrombocytopenia [HIT]). Type I HIT is a nonimmunologic 
heparin-­induced platelet sequestration, while type II HIT is immune 
mediated (heparin platelet factor antibody) and associated with throm­
bosis (deep venous, pulmonary embolism, necrotizing cutaneous 
lesions).

SECTION 9  Hematologic Disorders
Fibrinolytic Therapy
Fibrinolytic therapy is indicated for serious and potentially life-­
threatening thrombosis because it provides a more rapid lysis of clots 
than standard anticoagulant treatment with heparin and is clinically 
effective in both arterial and venous clots. Because bleeding compli­
cations are many times higher than those with heparin in older indi­
viduals, the clinical severity of the clot must justify the use of lytic 
therapy, such as a life-­ or limb-­threatening extremity clot or a pulmo­
nary embolus resulting in cardiac compromise. For smaller thrombi or 
those in nonvital locations, heparin is safe and effective. Lytic therapy 
is best used early in the evolution of the thrombus. If the clot has been 
long-­standing, it is unlikely that fibrinolytic therapy will be efficacious.
The presence of any intracranial process, recent major surgery, or 
recent significant bleeding is an absolute contraindication to fibrino­
lytic therapy and a relative contraindication to heparin treatment. In 
patients with a normal cranial sonogram (or CT) and complete occlu­
sion of the aorta or evidence of compromise of major organ function, 
fibrinolytic therapy has been safely and successfully administered 
with very careful monitoring. Table 51.12 outlines dose and monitor­
ing studies for two commonly used fibrinolytic agents: recombinant 
TPA and urokinase. Fibrinolytic therapy appears to result in a more 
rapid return of pulmonary artery flow after pulmonary emboli and 
may decrease the likelihood and/or severity of postphlebitic syndrome 
after deep vein thrombosis, though this is a starkly understudied area 
in pediatrics.
Input from an interventional radiologist may be useful to discuss 
various options, such as systemic vs local (catheter-­directed) throm­
bolysis and any potential role for mechanical lysis.
Warfarin
Warfarin has long been the anticoagulant of choice for long-­term oral 
therapy, though direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are becoming 
more well studied in children. Warfarin acts by blocking the vitamin 
K–dependent post-­translational modification of factors 2, 7, 9, and 10 
and of PC and PS. The usual warfarin starting dose is 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/day. 
Younger children appear to require higher doses to achieve a therapeutic 
level of the INR. Due to the changes in warfarin metabolism that may 
occur because of concomitant medications or varying amounts of vita­
min K in a diet, frequent blood testing may be needed to maintain an 
adequate INR. If warfarin therapy is started early in the course of heparin 
therapy for thrombotic disease, effective oral anticoagulant effect is often 
achieved by day 5, at which time levels of all the vitamin K–dependent 
factors should be depressed by warfarin. Early in the course of treatment 
with warfarin, the PT is affected first because factor 7 has the shortest 
half-­life of the vitamin K–dependent procoagulants and factor 7 levels 
fall briskly after warfarin treatment. The next levels that fall are PC and 
PS, followed by the other clotting factors. Therefore, in the first several 
days warfarin must be coadministered with UFH or LMWH so as to 
avoid a temporary hypercoagulable state. The aim of warfarin therapy 
for venous thromboembolic disease is to achieve a stable INR of approx­
imately 2.0–3.0, though specific range may vary based on clinical indica­
tion. For example, for prevention of embolization from prosthetic valves, 
a higher INR may be preferable. Patients with PC or PS deficiency are 
at risk for warfarin-­induced skin necrosis when warfarin therapy is ini­
tiated, particularly if high doses are used. These individuals should be 
given heparin before warfarin is started, and they should not receive a 
loading/high dose of warfarin.
Warfarin may be reversed by administration of either IV or oral 
vitamin K. Although IV vitamin K may work slightly faster, response 
rates at 24 hours are identical and IV vitamin K carries the associated 
risk for overcorrection and prolonged subtherapeutic INRs. Therefore, 
oral administration is preferable for non–life-­threatening bleeding.
Direct Oral Anticoagulant Therapy
DOACs appear to be at least as effective as warfarin and possibly safer 
(Table 51.15). It should be noted that some specific diagnoses may still 
require warfarin, including patients with antiphospholipid antibody 
syndrome and some patients with cardiac issues.

Bleeding and thrombotic problems are often familial but may also be 
acquired. A family history and personal history that quantitate bleeding 
episodes are of utmost help in planning an evaluation. Red flags include 
anemia; signs of end-­organ bleeding or vascular occlusion, particularly 
the central nervous system; signs of a systemic disorder (pancytopenia, 
hypotension, rash, weight loss, chronic fever, liver–renal–pulmonary 
system involvement); and signs of hemorrhagic shock.
