SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Calories from food provide energy for the body’s maintenance func­
tions of repair, regulation, metabolism, replacement of losses, and daily 
activity. Children have additional caloric requirements because they 
are growing. Children under the age of 3 years whose caloric needs 
are not met do not grow according to published norms and are said 
to have failure to thrive (FTT) or growth faltering. FTT raises serious 
concerns. It is important to have a systematic, stepwise approach to the 
diagnosis and management of poor growth in young children and to 
follow growth over time.
The term failure to thrive describes growth failure that accompa­
nies many pathologic as well as psychosocial causes. Differentiation 
between organic (biomedical) and nonorganic (psychosocial/environ­
mental) is not always useful; children often have a combination of psy­
chosocial and biomedical problems. Children with medical conditions 
will often have psychosocial issues related to eating and dysfunctional 
feeding patterns. Children with primarily social or emotional issues 
around eating may develop medical consequences of undernutrition.
The best diagnostic tool available to the clinician is a comprehensive 
history, including diet, growth (over time), family and social histories, 
and a complete review of systems. A thorough physical examination 
is necessary. Further work-­up should be directed by results from this 
initial evaluation. There is a poor yield from exhaustive laboratory 
evaluations. Children with either biomedical or psychosocial causes of 
FTT may or may not gain weight in institutional settings; short-­term 
outcome may not be diagnostic.
NORMAL GROWTH
Newborns typically lose up to 10–12% of their birthweight during the 
first few days of life and regain this weight by the age of 2 weeks. Sub­
sequently, they gain weight at a steady pace of about 1 ounce per day 
for the first 2 or 3 months; they gain at half to two thirds that rate for 
the next 3 months and half to two thirds again for the next 6 months. 
This results in a doubling of birthweight by the age of 4–6 months and a 
tripling at about 1 year. Height and head circumference grow at similar 
well-­defined rates. These three growth parameters, along with weight/
length, should be plotted on appropriate growth charts and monitored 
for adherence to standard growth rates. Children grow in a stepwise 
manner, but on average their growth pattern follows the accepted 
curves (see Chapter 56). Online tools are available to assist with the 
determination of growth status (http://peditools.org).
By the age of 3 years, if caloric intake is normal, the child’s growth 
adjusts to their genetic potential. Ultimate height is determined by 
additional factors, among them rates of bone maturity and pubertal 
development (see Chapter 56). Considerable energy from ingested 
food is required to achieve this growth. The energy balance can be 
described by the following equation, in which E equals energy:
	
EIN = EOUT + Egrowth + Estored	
EOUT is the sum of the basal metabolic rate, energy expended in 
physical activity, and energy needed for food digestion. Children 
should be in a positive energy balance for growth. Any imbalance in 
this energy equation (losing or using more calories than are ingested) 
results in abnormal growth patterns. Weight is usually affected first, 
followed by height and finally head circumference if the energy imbal­
ance is severe and prolonged in young children.
DEFINITIONS
FTT is a sign, not a diagnosis. FTT is generally used to describe chil­
dren younger than 2 or 3 years who meet any of the following criteria:
	1.	 Growth under the third percentile on World Health Organization 
(WHO) weight-­for-­age growth charts (less than 2 standard devia­
tions [SD] below mean)
	2.	 Weight for height or body mass index (BMI) less than the third per­
centile
	3.	 Growth patterns that have crossed two major percentiles downward 
on the weight-­for-­age charts within 6 months
	4.	 Growth velocity less than normal for age
There are inherent problems with these definitions. Two percent of 
the normal population is under 2 SD below the mean; those who are 
growing appropriately per their genetic potential must be differentiated 
from those with growth problems. The child who has been obese and is 
now approaching normal weight, crossing major weight percentiles in 
the process, should not be considered a child with FTT. Some children 
are naturally slim. The clinician must exercise considerable judgment 
before raising the concern of poor growth.
Additional terms are used to describe children who are not growing 
well. A child has wasting if the weight for length (or height) is below 
–2 SD (or −2 z-­scores, which is equal to <2nd centile). Stunting is 
defined as a child whose height or length is less than −2 z-­scores due to 
chronic undernutrition. In the third year of life, children are described

as underweight if weight/age is <3% or if BMI is <5%. Short stature or 
microcephaly alone is not due to nutritional deficiencies (Table 12.1).
INTERPRETATION OF GROWTH CHARTS
The evaluation for any child who is not growing well includes a care­
ful analysis of the growth pattern over time. Measurements of length 
are the most susceptible to error; standard procedures should be used 
(see Chapter 56). Possible errors in weight, head circumference, date of 
birth, or plotting on the growth chart should all be considered. Once 
the correct data are available, the charts should be examined to answer 
the following questions:
 • Are the measurements of length and weight proportional?
 • Has the head grown adequately?
 • How severe are the deficits of each measurement, relative to what is 
expected?
 • When did the problem start; what is the progression?
 • What environmental factors were present at the start of this process 
(weaning, introduction of new foods, food insecurity)?
Although weight is usually the most readily available measurement, 
measurement of length is particularly critical, because it serves as the 
point of reference for other diagnostic considerations. The best way to 
obtain accurate length measurements is to use a specially calibrated 
length board with a fixed headpiece and a movable footpiece. In the 
absence of such a device, the examiner can use a table or desk with the 
infant’s head pressed against the wall and a firm square box or thick 
textbook for the sliding footer. Measurements obtained with the infant 
lying on a mattress and marked with a pen on the sheet are not accurate 
(see Chapter 56).
The choice of growth curves is important. In the United States, the 
recommendation is to use the WHO charts from birth through the sec­
ond year of life (http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm) 
(see Chapter 56). Some children previously classified as FTT will fall 
into the normal range. Their health status may be poorer than those 
within normal ranges on both charts. The 2000 age-­ and gender-­
specific National Center for Health Statistics growth charts published 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention combined data 
across geographic and ethnic populations and are appropriate to use 
for children over 24 months of age.
Conventions (for premature infants) differ in whether to plot age in 
relation to actual birth date or to use corrected gestational age. Growth 
charts following children prenatally to infancy are available (see Fenton 
and Olsen at http://peditools.org). Beyond the equivalent of 40 weeks 
of gestation, standard charts can be used, keeping in mind that prema­
ture infants may not catch up on all parameters for 2 or 3 years.
Because infants with FTT no longer follow their growth curves, the 
usual convention of expressing growth measurements in relation to 
normal percentiles is not always useful; weight/length or BMI z-­scores 
better define and assess the degree of malnutrition. Children with 
moderate wasting have weight for height below −2 SD of the WHO 
Child Growth Standards median; severe wasting is defined as weight 
for height below −3 SD.
It is important to note the following points:
	1.	 Infants and toddlers who are short in proportion to weight should 
be considered to have primary growth problems, including vari­
ous endocrine (often growth hormone) and skeletal dysplasias (see 
Chapter 56) (see Table 12.1).
	2.	 Infants who have had inadequate caloric intake will be abnormally 
thin. If the problem developed at some time after birth, weight will 
drop off before changes in length or head circumference.
	3.	 Infants with disproportionately small heads may have primary neu­
rologic or genetic (monogenetic, microdeletion, aneuploidy, syn­
dromic) problems affecting brain growth because head growth is 
the last to be affected by malnutrition and is not characteristic of 
primary skeletal growth problems (see Table 12.1). An alternative 
diagnosis is craniosynostosis, or early closure of skull growth plates.
Several examples of how these patterns may be interpreted are 
presented in Figures 12.1 to 12.4. Growth charts adjusted for abnor­
mal head size (micro-­ or macrocephaly) are not available. This factor 
becomes relatively less important as the child ages, but during infancy 
it may significantly affect the weight percentile and requires clinical 
judgment to assess.
Syndrome-­specific growth charts have been developed for certain 
populations (e.g., trisomy 21, skeletal dysplasias). Their use is most 
appropriate for conditions that affect muscle and bone development 
(e.g., Russell-­Silver syndrome). All other disease-­specific charts should 
be used in conjunction with the WHO charts. Accuracy of some of 
these charts is suspect.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
FTT is found in all populations but has a higher prevalence among 
children of low socioeconomic status compared to those in higher 
socioeconomic groups. FTT accounts for up to 5% of all hospitaliza­
tions; up to 10% of children may have FTT at some point in time. Most 
affected children with nutritional problems present before the age of 
3 years.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Parents often voice concerns about their young child’s weight gain. 
They may complain that their child is a picky eater or seems not to 
drink enough formula, or they worry that breast milk supply is inade­
quate. Very commonly, parents complain that their child is not as big

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
as a similar-­aged child or a sibling at that age. Many such children are 
growing normally. Plotting the child’s growth and reviewing it with 
the parents may be reassuring, or it may serve to confirm the parents’ 
concerns. When families raise concerns about growth, regardless of 
whether a problem exists, the child and the weight have already become 
a focus of concern for that family. Often parents have already put a 
great deal of effort into changing the child’s eating patterns, leading 
to intrafamily conflict. In this setting, conversations about the child’s 
growth may carry a high emotional charge.
However, it is often the physician who is first to raise concerns. 
These suspicions can be confirmed by carefully plotting the growth 
parameters. The clinician must then prioritize the clinical issues and 
decide whether the FTT should be addressed immediately or deferred 
for evaluation and management at another time in the very near future. 
In rare cases, the growth failure is so severe that immediate hospital­
ization is indicated for nutritional rehabilitation. In this case, the 
evaluation can take place over several days, while therapeutic nutri­
tional interventions are ongoing.
APPROACH TO DETERMINING ETIOLOGY
Clinicians need to have a broad approach to determining etiology of 
FTT for each child. Many children with FTT, particularly those with 
chronic diseases, have a mixed pattern of increased needs or losses 
attributable to organic causes, along with environmental causes lead­
ing to calorie deprivation.
There are several growth conditions that result in smaller than nor­
mal size that are not due to calorie insufficiency. Infants who are born 
symmetrically small in all growth parameters are believed to have a 
reduced number of somatic cells in relation to their normal-­sized peers 
as a result of an early intrauterine event. Infants who are asymmetrically 
small for gestational age, with sparing of the head circumference and

possibly length, had a late intrauterine event, such as poor maternal 
nutrition or placental insufficiency. These infants often eat voraciously 
and experience catch-­up growth early in life. Children with constitu­
tional growth delay usually grow normally over the first few years, but 
weight and height decelerate to near or below the 2nd percentile fol­
lowed by growth at normal rates along their new curve (see Chapter 
56). The symmetric deceleration of height and weight is a clue that the 
child does not have calorie insufficiency. Children with genetic causes 
of short stature have short height for age with appropriate low weight 
(see Table 12.1).
Children with FTT caused by calorie insufficiency typically have 
decreased weight gain, at first with sparing of height and head circum­
ference (wasting). Long-­standing calorie insufficiency results in height 
deceleration (stunting). Decrease in height or length is the best pre­
dictor of chronic malnutrition. Only in the worst, long-­standing cases 
is head growth decreased. This typical pattern suggests calorie insuffi­
ciency and informs the clinician of the chronicity of the problem.
There are several approaches to the differential diagnosis. The func­
tional approach determines whether there is a problem with inade­
quate calorie intake, increased calorie requirement or utilization, or 
increased calorie loss (Table 12.2). The systems approach focuses on 
the identification of the organ system(s) responsible for poor growth 
(Table 12.3).
Another approach is to consider the age at onset, the child’s devel­
opmental level, and the conditions likely to manifest at that stage of 
development. The causes of prenatal growth problems include environ­
mental toxins, maternal drug and alcohol use, prenatal infection, con­
genital syndromes, placental insufficiency, and poor prenatal nutrition. 
Poor growth immediately after birth can be associated with maternal 
postpartum depression, bonding and attachment disorders, incorrect 
formula preparation, failure to establish breast-­feeding, and congenital 
anomalies or metabolic conditions. Difficulty with transition to solid 
foods results in poor growth from 6 to 12 months. In children older 
than 9 months, issues of separation and autonomy may result in power

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
struggles over eating, resulting in insufficient intake. For toddlers, poor 
food choices (empty calories found in juice drinks and snack foods), 
dysfunctional feeding interaction (restriction of self-­feeding or lack of 
structure around meals), and distraction (chaotic home environment, 
television and electronic devices) may interfere with adequate food 
intake.
History
The history is the most important part of the evaluation of the child 
with FTT and guides the evaluation.
History of the Present Illness
The clinician who first notices poor growth should identify whether the 
family perceives a problem. What is the family members’ perception 
of the child’s food intake? When, if ever, was the problem suspected? 
What changes have they made to address the problem? Asking these 
questions in a nonjudgmental manner will reassure the family that the 
clinician regards them as partners in the task of improving the child’s 
growth.
A detailed feeding history should start with infant feeding; dietary 
sources and growth patterns should be chronologically reviewed. Was 
the child breast-­ or formula-­fed? If breast-­fed, were there any problems 
with milk sufficiency? Did the mother feel emotionally supported in 
her choice to breast-­feed? If the child was formula-­fed, what was the 
formula; how was it mixed; was there ever any reason to change for­
mula? Was feeding a pleasurable or a difficult experience for the par­
ent and child? These questions may give insight into problematic early 
parent-­child interaction.
If the child is beyond infancy, when and how were solid foods 
introduced? Were there any specific food refusals that might indicate 
an allergy or intolerance? How did the child accept solids? What are the 
child’s food preferences? When did the child start to self-­feed and how

SECTION 4   Gastrointestinal Disorders
did the family manage messiness? Where does the child eat? Is there 
a high chair or booster seat? Are there family meals, or does the child 
eat alone? What is going on in the immediate environment when the 
child is eating? Did a traumatic event trigger the eating problem? These 
questions can reveal dysfunctional eating behaviors that can affect the 
child’s intake.
Questions about unusual eating habits or pica may indicate nutri­
tional deficiencies, such as iron deficiency (Table 12.4). Children with 
difficult temperaments may have problematic eating behaviors. Are the 
parents forcing the child to eat?
Does the child have difficulty taking or manipulating food in the 
mouth? Is there frequent choking on food? Does the child drool? Is 
there food refusal or aversion suggesting dysphagia? If the response 
to any of these questions is confirmatory, consider difficulty with 
oral motor control. This is common among children with neurologic 
problems.
Obtaining a daily schedule of meals and activities is very helpful. 
What foods are prepared and offered by other caregivers? Is there a 
difference in how the child eats when the child is with the parents in 
comparison to other caretakers?
A careful dietary history is imperative. The 24-­hour recall is stan­
dard, although some authorities question its validity. The clinician asks 
the parent to remember everything the child ate in the past 24 hours 
and whether that was a typical day. It is helpful to start with the present 
and work backward. Alternatively, the parent may keep a 3-­day food 
diary. The diary should be structured so that the type of food, quantity,

Fig. 12.4  Growth curve of an infant male with acute weight loss and catch-­up weight gain. Before the age 
of 41/2 months, there was normal growth while he was breast-­feeding. After a change to an inadequate 
weaning diet, severe weight loss developed, but less impairment of length occurred. Head size was not 
affected. An acute episode of diarrhea led to multiple dietary changes that resulted in further weight loss. 
With a proper diet history, nutritional rehabilitation with a balanced diet resolved this child’s problem. This 
may also be a pattern of a child with celiac disease. (Modified from National Center for Health Statistics:

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
method of preparation, and amount eaten are recorded; beverages 
should be included. The caregiver should receive prior instruction 
regarding how to estimate portions and to include only what the child 
actually eats.
Diet review is a good opportunity to explore parental beliefs 
about food and the feeding of children (e.g., children must drink 
water, they need lots of milk, juice is good for them, fat should be 
restricted to prevent obesity and heart disease). It may be useful to 
explore parent assumptions about food based on their own experi­
ences or beliefs. The parent who sees the child as vulnerable may 
be overanxious and rigid about food intake. Cultural norms may 
dictate certain food choices, which may not provide optimal nutri­
tion. Vegetarian diets may provide insufficient protein, vitamins D 
and B12, and iron. Parents may substitute goat’s milk (deficient in 
folate) or rice or almond milk (low in protein) for cow’s milk–based 
nutrition.
Medical History
The prenatal and perinatal history begins with the mother’s age, 
general health, and parity. Was this pregnancy planned? What were 
the parents’ reactions to the pregnancy? Did the mother have any 
emotional problems during or before her pregnancy? What was her 
alcohol, tobacco, and drug intake during pregnancy? When was prena­
tal care begun? Were there sufficient visits to monitor the pregnancy? 
How much weight did she gain? Were there any complications such as 
sexually transmitted and other infections? Were they hoping for a boy 
or a girl?
The perinatal history includes problems with labor, method of deliv­
ery, gestational age, and the newborn’s growth parameters at birth (i.e., 
appropriate [AGA], small [SGA], or large [LGA] for gestational age). 
Is this an SGA infant who needs extra calories for catch-­up growth 
or a newborn with intrauterine growth restriction who is small in all 
growth parameters? Did the baby have any problems in the nursery? A 
nursery stay of more than 2–3 days following a vaginal birth may indi­
cate a problem with the newborn. Did the baby have feeding problems 
after birth? Was breast-­feeding begun immediately?
The child’s medical history should be reviewed for chronic condi­
tions and recurrent, acute conditions, such as recurrent emesis, diar­
rhea, constipation, neurologic symptoms, or recurrent infections. 
Hospitalizations, surgical procedures, medications, allergies, and 
immunization status should be ascertained. Among children hospital­
ized with FTT, over 40% have an underlying chronic condition and 
some have two or more chronic conditions. It is essential to docu­
ment neurodevelopmental progress, because motor or cognitive delays 
could be associated with neurologic dysfunction that increases calorie 
requirements and/or decreases feeding efficiency.
Family History
The clinician should ascertain the growth of siblings and other fam­
ily members. Are there patterns of growth in the family that might 
result in a child growing slower than expected? What differences 
or similarities do the parents notice between this child and their 
other children? What were the growth patterns and ultimate sizes 
of the parents and grandparents? Document the age at menarche 
and puberty in parents and siblings. Creating a two-­generation gen­
ogram that includes the height and weight of each family member 
may provide clues to the growth potential of the patient. Plotting 
the mean parental height on the child’s height curve will help to 
predict ultimate stature.
A thorough family history is important. This should include early 
childhood deaths and any family members with genetic or metabolic 
conditions. Is there a family history of mental illness that might affect 
the child or the caretakers? Is there consanguinity?
Social History
Many cases of FTT do not have a primary medical etiology, and thus 
the social history is vital. Determine the family constellation. What is 
the relationship of the adults in the household, and how do they get 
along? Are the parents working, and if so, who cares for the child? Chil­
dren with FTT come from all socioeconomic groups. Do the parents 
have nearby food stores as well as adequate storage, refrigeration, and 
food preparation space? Are there adequate eating facilities and imple­
ments? Are there siblings who might eat the child’s food? Is the child 
enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program? Food 
insecure families may be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assis­
tance Program (SNAP); both are programs of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. What is the cultural context of food selection and eating 
behavior?
More difficult social issues must be approached carefully, with a 
statement to the family that all patients with this problem are asked 
these routine questions. Families should be screened for substance use 
that might result in use of food money for tobacco, alcohol, or drugs,

as well as inadequate child care. Prior involvement of child protection 
authorities is relevant.
Is the child in group daycare, or has the family traveled to or 
emigrated from an area where a chronic infection such as a parasite 
might have been acquired? Although the social history can be the 
most revealing part of the history, it can be the most difficult to elicit. 
Often the clinician must establish trust with the family before they 
can reveal the source of their inability to meet their child’s nutritional 
needs.
Review of Systems
A thorough review of systems can help to reveal organic conditions. A 
few areas merit special attention to determine sources of calorie loss or 
increased metabolic demands.
Constitutional: The examiner should ask whether there are any 
fevers, night sweats, or changes in activity. Assess sleep hygiene, 
amount of sleep, and whether sleep is disrupted by snoring or 
awakenings.
Gastrointestinal: Inquire about choking, swallowing, dysphagia, 
vomiting, spitting up, and rumination. Pocketing food, or retaining 
food in the mouth, may indicate oral motor dysfunction that impedes 
adequate intake. Night waking and coughing may indicate reflux. Diar­
rhea, constipation, abdominal pain, early satiety, distention, and dis­
comfort indicate organic conditions.
Cardiopulmonary: The examiner should ask about coughing, 
wheezing, shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and early tiring 
during feeding.
Renal: Inquire about dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary fre­
quency or volume, secondary enuresis, and urine that seems unusually 
dilute or concentrated.
Physical Examination
The examination should start with accurate measurements of height 
or length, weight, and head circumference; these parameters should 
be plotted on a standard growth curve. Weight for height or BMI (if 
older than 2 years of age) should also be plotted. Historical events

should be identified and plotted to discover impact on growth 
patterns.
As part of a complete physical examination, the following signs 
should be sought:
General: degree of emaciation, fat distribution and muscle mass, 
dysmorphic features, vital signs (including blood pressure), hydration 
status.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat: fontanel size, evidence of chronic 
ear infections, allergic facies, patency of upper airway, status of teeth
Cardiorespiratory: respiratory effort, lower airway sounds, cardiac 
sounds, pulses, edema
Gastrointestinal: organomegaly, abdominal distention, rectal fis­
sures or prolapse
Genitourinary: renal masses, Tanner staging
Musculoskeletal: joint swelling, bone deformities
Skin: hydration, bruising or scarring, rashes, hair quality and distri­
bution, nails (Figs. 12.5 and 12.6)
Lymph nodes: local vs generalized (see Chapter 48)
Neurologic: muscle volume, tone (hypo-­ or hypertonic), strength, 
coordination, swallowing and drooling, assessment of development 
and interaction with the examiner
Abnormalities associated with pathologic biomedical conditions 
should prompt a search for a specific diagnosis (see Table 12.3).

SECTION 4   Gastrointestinal Disorders
be associated with specific nutrient deficiencies (Tables 12.4, 12.5, 
and 12.6).
Laboratory Evaluation
Almost any serious chronic illness may result in FTT; therefore, 
the examiner must have a broad diagnostic screening approach and 
simultaneously consider the more likely possibility that nonmedical 
processes are the cause. In most cases of chronic “organic” illness, 
there is likely some indication in the history, physical examination, 
or selected diagnostic screening tests (Table 12.7). In cases where an 
underlying illness is not detected by these screening tests, the condi­
tion may become evident when the infant does not respond to nutri­
tional rehabilitation. If, however, the examiner attempts to pursue 
every conceivable diagnostic test for organic causes of FTT before 
implementing vigorous nutritional rehabilitation, the examiner is 
likely to run out of time, patience, and resources and come to no con­
clusion. Some unusual cases may take months or years before a diag­
nosis can be made.
The choice of the appropriate initial laboratory tests may include 
several general screening tests to detect treatable conditions. A CBC 
can reveal clinically inapparent anemia, which, although usually sec­
ondary to the poor nutritional state, can sometimes contribute to the 
poor dietary intake or suggest anemia of chronic disease. A UA and 
urine culture can reveal evidence of an occult urinary tract infection or 
renal tubular acidosis. Serum electrolytes with BUN level may detect 
metabolic conditions. An ESR or CRP may provide evidence of chronic 
inflammation or infection. The examiner may need to test for celiac

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
and FTT, a blood lead test, metabolic screening tests, a karyotype or 
other genetic testing (microarray), imaging of the head, or HIV screen­
ing may be necessary, whereas a child with apparent malabsorption 
is evaluated completely differently (targeting cystic fibrosis, inflamma­
tory bowel disease, celiac disease, or parasitic infection). An endoscopy 
may be needed to determine eosinophilic infiltration into the gastroin­
testinal mucosa. If height growth is affected, a bone age may determine 
if an endocrine evaluation is necessary. Consultation with specialists 
will be needed in many cases.
OVERALL APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT
The evaluation of a child with FTT should proceed in a stepwise 
manner (Fig. 12.7). Once the clinician has arrived at a working 
diagnosis, treatment can be instituted. It is important to develop a 
therapeutic alliance with family members. Parents whose children 
are not growing according to expectation may feel guilty or may 
have a sense of failure. A nonjudgmental approach, avoiding the 
assignment of blame, is important. Although the clinician can make 
suggestions, it is the family that must feel empowered to implement 
the plan.
Providing specific information that can be easily implemented in 
the family’s home environment will be more successful than giving 
general advice. Suggestions that a parent feed more food to a child 
may be disregarded, particularly when the family members believe 
they are already doing their best. Pressuring parents may increase 
caregiver guilt, frustration, and anxiety if the child does not grow as 
expected.
Even with the strong suspicion of a biomedical cause, it is reason­
able to give specific advice on enhancing calorie intake while further 
evaluation and treatment are ongoing. If the condition is chronic, the 
child may need long-­term nutritional supplementation. If the condi­
tion is acute and treatable, the child needs extra calories for catch-­up 
growth.
Steps to Improve Calorie Intake
Mealtime Behavior
A pleasant, safe setting should be created for mealtime. An infant seat 
is appropriate for the first several months. Once a child can sustain a 
sitting position, a high chair is advantageous. The high chair allows 
the child to feel safe from falling, frees up the child’s hands for feeding, 
and keeps the child confined in one place to focus on the meal. A bib 
prevents the need for frequent changes of clothing. For an older child, 
a booster seat is appropriate along with child-­sized utensils. Parents 
who feed an infant or toddler while holding the child in their laps find 
that the meal is a struggle; this also prevents the child from developing 
self-­feeding skills.
To promote the important social aspect of mealtime, family mem­
bers should be seated and eat together whenever possible. Use of a 
small, child-­sized table and chair prevents the child from observing 
and learning from siblings and adults during family meals. Toddlers 
and older infants are usually interested in the food served to other fam­
ily members, leading to experimentation with new foods. There should 
be conversation during the meal, but the child’s food intake should not 
be the focus of the conversation.
Distractions should be minimized during meals. The television and 
other electronic media should be off. There should not be other com­
motion in the kitchen. However, for the infant, a small washable toy on 
the tray or table may help keep attention on the meal.
Parents should understand that experimenting with food is part of 
the natural curiosity of older infants and toddlers. If the parent is con­
stantly wiping the child and berating the child for getting messy, the 
child cannot learn that eating can be a fun experience. If a parent has 
difficulty with messiness, the examiner can suggest spreading newspa­
per or a plastic sheet under the high chair. Another simple technique 
is the “two-­spoon method”; the child holds a spoon to dip into the 
food, and the parent has the second spoon, which provides most of 
the feeding.
Once the child has communicated that the meal is finished, the 
parent can offer one or two more bites but then should accept that 
the child is no longer hungry, and the meal should be ended. The 
duration of the meal for a toddler is typically not more than 15 or 20 
minutes. Food should not be brought out until the next scheduled 
meal or snack.
Beverages
Exclusive breast-­feeding is the preferred nutritional source for infants 
from birth to at least 6 months. Formula-­fed infants should be held 
during a feeding until they are able to sit on their own and hold the 
bottle. Both breast milk and formula can be fortified for additional 
calories per ounce. Bottles should never be propped. After 1 year of 
age, breast milk may continue but formula is changed to cow’s milk. 
Although 1–2% milk is acceptable, whole milk is preferred for under­
weight toddlers. The volume of formula or whole cow’s milk consumed 
should be about 24 ounces per day. If a child is drinking an excessive

amount of formula, review the preparation procedures to ensure that 
the proper dilution is used.
Children naturally enjoy sweet foods. However, if they are intro­
duced early or used instead of more nutritionally complete foods, 
children may develop a preference for sweets, especially juices. In par­
ticular, toddlers who are allowed to have bottles with sweetened juices 
throughout the day eat little at mealtime, resulting in undernutrition. 
In addition, because of limited absorption of dietary sugars, particu­
larly in juices with high fructose-­to-­glucose ratios (such as apple and 
pear juice), excessive juice intake may result in bloating, excessive 
flatulence, abdominal pain, and chronic diarrhea due to carbohydrate 
malabsorption. Juice should not be introduced until after 12 months of 
age. When introduced, only 100% fruit juice should be offered in a cup. 
Intake should be limited to 4 ounces per day for toddlers, 4–6 ounces 
per day for preschoolers, and 8 ounces per day for older children and 
adolescents.
Various methods are available to enhance the calorie density of 
infant dietary beverages for nutritional supplementation. Formu­
las can be made with less water. Polycose and vegetable oils can be 
added. Pumped/expressed breast milk can be enhanced with breast 
milk fortifier (premature infants) or powdered formula (full-­term 
infants).
Food Selection
Complementary foods should be introduced after 4 or 6 months. 
Infants and young toddlers may have preferences for certain food 
textures, temperatures, and presentations. These preferences are often 
short-­lived. Normal children may become “picky” eaters in the sec­
ond and third years of life, generally refusing vegetables and fruits. 
New foods should routinely be introduced but not forced on the child. 
With reintroduction (up to 10 times may be required) and modeling, 
children will try new foods. For some children, food preferences may

be strong and cyclic. For example, a child may go through a cycle 
in which they request peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for nearly 
every meal. If a variety of fruits or vegetables are given along with 
the sandwich, this may be a reasonable compromise. Including older 
children in food shopping and preparation will increase interest in 
eating. At mealtime, older toddlers and preschool-­aged children may 
be permitted some flexibility in food selection from two or three 
choices. Providing choices allows the child to assume some control 
over the meal. Each choice must be nutritionally sound and accept­
able to the parent. Parents should not become bound by social con­
straints when it comes to foods served at certain meals.
Although it is the caregiver’s responsibility to provide appropriate 
food, it is the child’s responsibility to decide on the quantity of food 
to be eaten. “Force feeding” will convince the child that mealtime is 
something to be feared. Parents must learn to read a child’s cues for 
hunger and satiety.

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
Daily Routines and Snacks
Once children are receiving solid foods, they should be on a regular 
schedule of meals served at predictable times during the day. This gen­
erally means three meals and two or three snacks per day for infants 
and toddlers. The practice of “grazing”—having food available to the 
child throughout the day—should not be allowed. Frequent snacking 
allows the child to be satiated, preventing interest in standard meals 
and resulting in poor nutrition. Planned snacks afford the opportunity 
to supplement the child’s diet with high-­quality foods with good nutri­
tional content. For toddlers and preschool-­aged children, beverages 
should be introduced only after a good portion of the meal has been 
eaten.
Calculating Caloric Need
To calculate the minimal daily caloric requirements needed for catch-­up 
growth, determine the weight age (age at which current weight would 
be at 50%) and recommended calories for weight age (Table 12.8). The 
ideal weight for current height (50% weight for current height) should 
also be determined. Calories needed for catch-­up growth are calculated 
as:
	(kcal/kg for weight age) × (ideal weight for height in kilograms)	
	
actual weight in kilograms	
Required kcal/kg by age are the following:
0–6 months = 108 kcal/kg
6–12 months = 98 kcal/kg
1–3 years = 102 kcal/kg
4–6 years = 90 kcal/kg
For most children, calories needed for catch-­up growth can be eas­
ily calculated as:
	(120 kcal / kg) × (ideal weight for height in kilograms)
actual weight in kilograms
	
Most infants will achieve catch-­up growth on 160–180 kcal/kg/day. 
Some infants may need considerably more, up to 1.5–2 times the daily 
requirements for catch-­up. Caloric intake can be estimated from the 
diet history.
NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION FOR THE OLDER 
INFANT AND CHILD
Several products are available for nutritional supplementation. The 
complete liquid formulations are excellent products; very similar nutri­
tional value can be found in packaged instant-­breakfast drinks when 
mixed with whole milk, at much lower cost. These nutrient-­dense bev­
erages should supplement the child’s diet, not supplant food.
Many food products (powdered milk, margarine, cheese, wheat 
germ, peanut butter) can be added to acceptable foods to increase cal­
ories. It is easier to increase caloric density than increase the amount 
of food eaten. Attention should be paid to maximizing protein intake 
needed for growth.
If a child does not seem to be taking an adequate variety of foods, a 
supplement of multivitamins with minerals may be indicated. Particu­
larly during periods of rapid catch-­up growth, additional vitamins and 
minerals can be beneficial. Iron and zinc deficiencies may impede nor­
mal growth (see Table 12.4). Supplementation of zinc and other trace 
minerals has been shown to enhance catch-­up growth in malnourished 
children. A trial of an appetite stimulant, such as cyproheptadine, can 
be effective in some children.
Referral Resources and Other Options
Multidisciplinary Team
Children with FTT have complex medical and psychosocial issues. 
A multidisciplinary approach is beneficial in complicated cases by 
relieving the primary medical care provider of the responsibilities of 
investigating the home situation, reviewing the family’s finances and 
resources, and observation of mealtime. Improvement is most likely 
when children are referred at younger ages. The team might include 
a physician, social worker, psychologist, nutritionist, nurse, child life 
specialist, and home visitor. The team then discusses the case and 
develops a plan for ongoing management. Children treated by teams 
have better outcomes than children receiving routine care.
The psychological evaluation may identify children with develop­
mental delays and can assess family stressors and identify strengths 
and weaknesses in the family. In some families, the child may be the 
indicator that there is an underlying disturbance, such as depression 
or marital stress. The psychologist can also offer support and reassur­
ance as the family goes through a difficult period caused by potential 
long-­term nutritional rehabilitation of the child. In addition, the psy­
chologist can help the caregiver understand that improving the feeding 
situation takes a great effort on the part of the parent as well as the child 
and that new strategies are required for successful weight gain.
The nutritionist’s expertise is essential for a thorough evaluation 
and follow-­up plan. When taking a complete nutritional history, the 
nutritionist can analyze the nutritional and caloric values of the foods 
eaten. Alternative meal plans can be developed to maximize calories 
and nutritional content.
A social worker’s contribution to the team is an assessment of the 
child’s environment and factors that may be contributing to the child’s 
poor growth. Areas for investigation include social supports, housing 
conditions (crowding, space for food storage, proper refrigeration), 
and food insecurity. Families may need assistance with arranging work 
leave, rearranging work schedules, transportation, or respite care. Fam­
ilies can be directed to community support services that focus on both 
social/emotional and material/financial issues. Participation in the 
WIC and SNAP programs ameliorates food insecurity. If child mal­
treatment is suspected, the social worker assists with communication 
with the appropriate social service agency.
When feasible, home observation provides a wealth of information 
to the clinician about the environment in which the child resides and 
eats meals. Does the child have an appropriate place in which to eat? 
Is there a supply of appropriate foods in the home? What are the other 
environmental factors that may be impeding the child’s growth? Stud­
ies of home interventions have had mixed success, but young children 
with the highest risks have improved developmental outcomes with 
home intervention.

SECTION 4   Gastrointestinal Disorders
Recording or Direct Observation
Observation or recording of a meal provides an opportunity to assess 
the child’s willingness and ability to participate in the meal, the par­
enting style, and the interaction between the child and parents. Feed­
ing is most successful when the parent is responsive to the child’s cues. 
Parents who are controlling, overly permissive, or neglectful will find 
the feeding situation unsuccessful. Parent and child strengths should 
be pointed out to the parent. Problematic communication, both ver­
bal and nonverbal, should be reviewed. Difficulties that are observed 
should be discussed and become the basis for further intervention.
Involvement of Social Service Agencies
Clinicians caring for children with FTT often find themselves work­
ing in conjunction with other agencies, including social service agen­
cies. Children who are refused food or are abused in any way must be 
reported. It may, however, be difficult to determine what constitutes 
neglectful care. Families that are disorganized and overwhelmed, 
have other pressing social issues, or refuse to follow recommenda­
tions, resulting in lack of sufficient progress in the child’s growth, 
must be reported to the local agency. This may include parents with 
cognitive deficits, mental health problems, or substance abuse. It is 
important for all agencies to work together and articulate a plan, so 
that the families involved do not receive conflicting instructions and 
messages.
Behavioral Strategies
In some situations, behavior modification programs are used. These 
may include strategies to determine specific parameters in the feeding 
environment that will improve the child’s intake. These may include 
colors, textures, tastes, etc. In more difficult cases, a strict behavior 
modification program may be used.
Non-­Oral Enteral Feeding
For some children, maximizing oral intake may nonetheless provide 
insufficient calories for catch-­up growth. The clinician may consider 
other forms of enteral feeding. This intervention is needed if, despite 
all other attempts to maximize oral feeding, the child’s growth is fall­
ing further below the third percentile or if the child is showing signs 
of severe malnourishment (e.g., hypoalbuminemia, or low prealbumin 
levels).
Initially, nasogastric (NG) feeding can be used for night feedings. 
The child should be encouraged to eat orally during the day. If the need 
for the NG tube is extended for a longer duration (some authorities 
use 3 months), then a referral should be made for placement of a per­
cutaneous gastrostomy tube (G-­tube). This is used for supplemental 
nutrition for most children and is not a substitute for oral intake. Chil­
dren receiving supplemental alimentation should be monitored very 
closely. Once the weight for height is approaching the 50th percentile, 
the supplement should be adjusted to prevent obesity. The G-­tube is 
removed when the child can sustain an adequate growth rate with oral 
intake only.
It is very important that some oral stimulation continue even if 
the G-­tube is the main source of nutrition. If children are denied the 
chance to develop competence in age-­appropriate feeding behaviors, 
they are likely to develop food aversions. This makes reintroduction of 
oral intake extremely difficult.
CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS
This category encompasses a variety of children: children with iso­
lated dysphagia for whom eating represents more work than pleasure, 
children with sensory issues for whom food tastes and textures can be 
experienced as adverse, and children who are technology dependent 
and not able to self-­regulate caloric intake.
During the medical assessment, if a child is found to have drool­
ing, coughing, gagging, pocketing of food in the cheek, or retention of 
food in the mouth, consider oral motor problems. An assessment by a 
speech therapist or occupational therapist with specific training in oral 
motor therapy can help reveal specific problems that are amenable to 
therapy. A modified barium swallow may be recommended to assess 
the risk of aspiration. Some children with oral motor dysfunction 
develop food aversion, as if it is not worth the effort to put anything 
in their mouths. Oral motor therapy or involvement in an intensive 
feeding program that addresses feeding therapy in a multidisciplinary 
fashion may be indicated for these children.
Children with autism often have sensory issues that cause feed­
ing aversion. Again, oral motor evaluation and therapy may be of 
help, but the therapy may need to focus on oral desensitization 
rather than motor skills. These children will sometimes accept only 
a very limited number of foods, or a single color or texture. The cli­
nician can ensure adequate micronutrient intake with vitamins and 
other supplements but may need to disguise them in the accepted 
foods.
Technology-­dependent children represent a very different chal­
lenge. Here, it is necessary to monitor growth regularly and adjust 
caloric intake as necessary. Increased activity or work, due perhaps to 
improved motor skills or decrease in respiratory support, can abruptly 
increase a child’s caloric need and cause weight loss if caloric intake is 
not increased. In general, increases of 10% are well tolerated and can 
be adequate to improve growth. This can be done by increasing volume 
or caloric density depending on the particular patient’s clinical situa­
tion. Follow-­up weight checks in 2–4 weeks can inform the clinician 
if the increase was adequate or excessive, and additional adjustments 
can be made. Failure to gain weight appropriately even with additional 
calories should prompt further evaluation for increased utilization or 
improper home feeding.
CRITERIA FOR HOSPITALIZATION
Decisions about when to hospitalize a child with FTT are inevitably 
influenced by practical considerations of the availability and quality 
of hospital services, cost, and distance from the family’s home. The 
medical issues are whether hospitalization will facilitate further diag­
nostic steps and whether the affected child is malnourished enough 
to create a sense of urgency about nutritional rehabilitation. Weight 
loss resulting in weight for height below −3 SD constitutes severe 
malnutrition and may require hospitalization. In addition, hospital­
ization is indicated if there is a concern about factitious disorder 
(Munchausen syndrome by proxy). In this situation, a parent may 
be purposefully manipulating the child to produce FTT or other 
symptoms.
Most children with FTT gain weight in the hospital within 1–2 
weeks, but obtaining a weight gain in a short amount of time does 
not prove that the home environment was the problem. Alternatively, 
even a 1–2-­week hospitalization in a child without an organic cause 
of the growth failure may not produce a sustainable weight gain. The 
foreign surroundings and lack of familiar faces might prevent the 
child from eating appropriately. Parents may not be able to remain 
with the child in the hospital if they have other small children to 
attend to at home.
Sufficient time must be anticipated in the hospital for substantial 
recovery; in severe cases, full recovery requires about 6 weeks. After

CHAPTER 12  Failure to Thrive
initial stabilization and reassurance that the infant is doing well, the 
child can spend much of this recovery period in a less expensive, non­
intensive supervised medical care facility that emphasizes nutritional 
support and psychosocial stimulation. Creative approaches to well-­
organized outpatient day programs or frequent home visiting by prop­
erly trained health care workers may provide an attractive alternative 
to hospitalization.
MONITORING
Long-­term follow-­up with periodic visits is required to ensure that 
initial weight gains are sustained. At the follow-­up visits, the 24-­
hour diet recall is assessed, or a 3-­day diet history is brought by the 
family. At all visits, the child’s growth parameters must be plotted. 
Dividing weight gained by the number of days since the last mea­
surement provides a mean growth rate. This can be compared with 
the normal growth rate in children by age group (see Table 12.8). A 
child in need of catch-­up growth should exceed the expected growth 
rate for normal children. Periodically, the family can be observed or 
recorded during a feeding session to determine improvement from 
prior sessions.
LONG-­TERM OUTCOMES
Children with early FTT may suffer long-­term consequences such as 
shorter adult height, less schooling, and diminished economic pro­
ductivity through changes in brain growth and function. However, 
outcomes may not be as ominous as early studies suggested. Paren­
tal self-­perceived competence, child adaptability, and adherence to 
nutritional and behavioral plans have been associated with good 
outcomes. Among those referred for management, younger child age 
and multiple child and family risk factors are associated with better 
weight gain.
Poverty and associated family and environmental problems may 
exacerbate the negative effects of FTT. Children with FTT who expe­
rience neglect are more likely to have poor outcomes. However, 
children who are diagnosed early and given appropriate treatment 
and family support services have better recovery than those who are 
treated later.
Children with a biomedical etiology that can be successfully man­
aged often do well. For those with undetermined causes or persistent 
FTT, outcomes can be poor. Growth may continue to be delayed. Ulti­
mate stature may be shorter than that predicted from mean parental 
heights (see Chapter 56).
Of interest is that with long-­term follow-­up, some children 
with FTT and rapid nutritional rehabilitation have been observed 
to develop obesity with long-­term consequences of insulin resis­
tance and cardiovascular risk. While rapid catch-­up growth may 
be desirable in some infants, slower weight recovery in other chil­
dren may have long-­term benefits. The factors that lead some chil­
dren to develop these consequences of overnutrition are not fully 
understood.
Poor developmental and cognitive outcomes have been found in 
many children with FTT; however, it is difficult to ascribe outcomes 
solely to the nutritional deficiencies. Those who were symmetrically 
small for gestational age and those with microcephaly are particu­
larly at risk for diminished cognitive potential; nutritional enhance­
ment may have minimal effect. Children who are stunted in the first 
2 years of life have poor long-­term outcomes. Home intervention by 
child development specialists may lessen the impact of FTT on cogni­
tive skills. Children should be referred for early intervention services 
as soon as deficits are detected. Better success will be achieved if inter­
vention is started early.
Children with FTT may manifest behavioral problems, even after 
the nutritional issues appear to be resolved. If the behaviors are par­
ticularly difficult to manage, the services of a psychologist or behavior 
specialist are warranted.
PROTEIN ENERGY MALNUTRITION
Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is traditionally a disorder of 
resource-­poor countries with multiple risk factors, the major risk being 
food insecurity. Features are noted in Table 12.9.
There is an increasing awareness of the presence of PEM 
in developed countries, most often due to parental beliefs that 
include food elimination diets from fear of food allergies or food 
protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (Fig. 12.8). Other risk 
factors include restrictive diets (autism, eating disorders), cultural 
remedies to treat feeding intolerance or other illnesses, and food 
fads. Concerns for cow’s milk protein allergy has resulted in food 
substitutions with low-­protein or low-­caloric-­density foods such 
as rice milk, nondairy creamers, formula dilution, home remedies 
of barley or potato juice or fruit purees, and poorly balanced vegan 
diets.
Hypoalbuminemia and edema are often present with a diffuse 
erythematous crusting, erosive, and desquamating rash (see Fig. 
12.5). The differential diagnosis of the rash includes Langerhans 
cell histiocytosis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, eczema, and sca­
bies. The differential diagnosis of the edema includes nephrotic syn­
drome; liver disease; and, because diarrhea is often present in PEM, 
a protein-­losing enteropathy (Table 12.10). Management is noted in 
Figure 12.8.

FTT (or growth faltering) is a complex condition encompassing bio­
medical and psychosocial causes. In the United States, it is most often 
associated with various psychosocial attributes of the parents, family, 
or child. The keys to determining the cause are a thorough history and 
physical examination, including assessment of the growth pattern over 
time. Red flags include refusal to eat, poor response to feedings, multi­
ple formula or diet changes, unusual parental food beliefs or fear of food 
allergies, an inappropriately small head size, and abnormal physical 
signs. Clinicians should be vigilant in identifying chronic disease as 
well as indicators of child abuse and neglect (see Table 12.3). Recurrent 
emesis, altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia 
should raise suspicions of an inborn error of metabolism. Microceph­
aly, seizures, developmental delay or developmental regression, and 
hypo-­ or hypertonia should lead to suspicions of a chronic neurologic 
problem. Identifying and treating the medical and psychosocial causes 
while enhancing calorie intake can result in better outcomes.
