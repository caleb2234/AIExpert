The etiology of intellectual developmental disabilities includes a 
wide spectrum of disorders that may present at different periods of 
development (infantile, juvenile, adult) and with different trajec­
tories (Fig. 28.1). Some are static encephalopathies (cerebral palsy, 
hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy), while others are progressive, 
resulting in intellectual, neurologic, and/or developmental regres­
sion (Table 28.1).
Dominant etiologic categories include:
 • Storage diseases including leukoencephalopathies
 • Inborn errors of metabolism including mitochondrial disorders
 • Genetic and idiopathic epilepsy encephalopathies
 • Cerebrovascular diseases
 • Trauma
Progressive neurocognitive regression is an uncommon but 
important presentation to recognize, diagnose, and potentially treat. 
The cardinal feature is usually first stagnation and then loss of devel­
opmental milestones in young children or loss of abilities, especially 
cognitive, in older children. The deficits can be slow or rapidly pro­
gressive and may or may not be accompanied by other neurologic 
signs and symptoms. Early recognition and treatment, when possible, 
may prevent permanent neurologic deficits. Distinguishing delayed 
development from arrested development or loss of skills can be chal­
lenging, especially on first presentation when there are insufficient 
data to predict the overall trajectory. The recognition of subtle fea­
tures depends on both parental reporting and careful developmental 
screening by primary care providers. Overt symptomatology or rapid 
decline is unlikely to go unnoticed and requires urgent evaluation in 
all cases. The differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions 
is broad and includes genetic, neurologic, infectious, immunologic, 
endocrine, traumatic, and idiopathic conditions. Initial referral to 
multiple specialists may be needed.
DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
Distinguishing delayed development from arrested development 
can be challenging, especially on first presentation when there are 
insufficient data to predict the overall trajectory. Normal develop­
ment can include brief, transient plateaus or minor losses of skills 
that occur prior to a significant leap forward in overall development 
or during concurrent illness. In such cases careful observation and 
close follow-­up will be reassuring. There are certain key elements 
to consider when taking a history or examining a patient that may 
trigger deeper exploration for the possibility of regression or intel­
lectual disability (ID) (Tables 28.2 and 28.3). Careful neurocogni­
tive assessment is essential when there are subtle or ill-­defined but 
concerning losses of skills or arrest of development. Referral for 
neuropsychologic evaluation is essential to correctly establish the 
specific areas of weakness or change and establish a baseline for the 
developmental diagnosis.
Developmental regression should be considered as a separate diag­
nostic entity, unique from global developmental delay (GDD) or ID 
(see Chapter 27) even though there are overlapping conditions. Iden­
tifying true regression, rather than failure of development, may be 
challenging and require close follow-­up over a period of time. Once 
regression is identified, evaluation is warranted.
If the arrest in development is more abrupt, global, or associ­
ated with other neurologic signs and symptoms, urgent evaluation 
is indicated. This may include referral to neurology and/or medi­
cal genetics, both basic labs (comprehensive metabolic panel, thy­
roid studies, blood counts) and specific laboratory studies based on 
accompanying symptoms, brain MRI, and EEG (Table 28.4 and Figs. 
28.2 and 28.3). A specific subset of metabolic disorders can pres­
ent with regression and various treatment options are available; it 
is thus important to recognize and diagnose these potentially treat­
able disorders (Tables 28.5 and 28.6). An exception to this rule is the 
loss of social and communication skills that precedes a diagnosis of 
autism in ∼30% of cases. Neuropsychologic evaluation is required 
to determine whether the regression is part of the autistic spectrum 
(see Chapter 32).
More than 300 neurodegenerative disorders have been described 
including genetic, neurologic, infectious, immunologic, endocrine, 
traumatic, and idiopathic conditions; additional classification 
based on progression and age is noted in Table 28.7 and in Figure 
28.2. Neurodegenerative disorders are often categorized as involv­
ing white matter, gray matter, basal ganglia, or the entire central 
nervous system. White matter diseases (e.g., adrenoleukodystro­
phy) affect long tracts and manifest with loss of motor skills, spas­
ticity, disturbed gait, areflexia (if peripheral nerve is also involved), 
or ataxia, whereas gray matter diseases (e.g., ceroid lipofuscino­
ses) manifest with seizures and abnormalities of cognition, vision, 
and hearing. Many disorders commonly classified as “white mat­
ter” or “gray matter” manifest with a mixed picture of signs and 
symptoms. Diseases that involve primarily the basal ganglia (deep 
gray matter), such as Huntington disease, manifest with cognitive 
deterioration, behavioral changes, rigidity, dystonia, ataxia, dysar­
thria, seizures, and incoordination. When these diseases progress, 
neurologic signs and symptoms may become more widespread and 
less specific.
Progressive disorders may be the result of metabolic or storage dis­
eases or due to a genetic syndrome (Rett syndrome). In contrast, static 
encephalopathies are usually the result of structural abnormalities due 
to abnormal development or trauma (see Tables 28.6 and 28.7).

SECTION 6  Developmental and Psychiatric Disorders
GENETIC EVALUATION
The genetic considerations for ID are detailed in Chapter 27. Next-­
generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides broad screening 
panels within a group of phenotypes (e.g., X-­Linked Intellectual 
Disability [XLID] panel). Genomic sequencing (whole exome 
sequencing [WES] and whole genome sequencing [WGS]) is trans­
forming the diagnostic process for children with neurodegenera­
tive disorders. Consideration for genome or exome sequencing as 
a first-­line approach in the presence of neurologic regression is 
becoming the standard of care. If there is progressive neurodevel­
opmental regression, exome/genome sequencing should be con­
sidered early in the diagnostic evaluation because many treatable 
disorders have improved outcomes with earlier initiation of therapy 
(i.e., mucopolysaccharidoses, Krabbe disease). This is especially 
true for young patients or more rapidly progressive neurodegener­
ative disease processes. Rapid genome/exome sequencing can pro­
vide results in as little as 5–10 days but is typically reserved for the 
intensive care setting.
Metabolic Tests
Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) should be suspected in children 
with acute or episodic neurologic abnormalities in whom there is unex­
plained altered mental status, vomiting, an unusual smell to the urine or 
body odor, metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate, hypoglycemia, or renal 
stones. IEMs may manifest as episodic acute encephalopathy (from an 
organic acidemia or hyperammonemia) or as a chronic progressive 
encephalopathy (with associated cardiomyopathy, spasticity, hyperre­
flexia, or liver dysfunction), often as a result of mitochondrial disorders 
or storage diseases (Tables 28.8 and 29.9). Routine neonatal screening 
for metabolic disorders may identify infants with IEMs that are asso­
ciated with GDD. However, not all children with IEMs manifest soon 
after birth, and normal results do not eliminate the possibility that an 
IEM is present. Targeted biochemical lab testing can be performed when 
a specific disease is considered (7-­dehydrocholesterol for Smith-­Lemli-­
Opitz syndrome, very-­long-­chain fatty acids for peroxisomal disorders, 
thyroxine [T4]/thyroid-­stimulating hormone [TSH] for hypothyroidism, 
creatinine kinase for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, glycosaminogly­
cans and oligosaccharides for lysosomal storage disorders such as Hunter 
or Hurler disease) (see Fig. 28.3). In general, few IEMs result in GDD/ID 
in the absence of other neurologic symptoms (see Table 28.8). To date, 89 
IEMs (and more, other disorders) have been identified that are amenable 
to treatment of the underlying defect and/or pathogenetic mechanism 
(Table 28.10). Of these, 54 (60%) can be identified by blood (plasma 
amino acids, homocysteine, copper, ceruloplasmin) and urine (creatine 
metabolites, glycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides, organic acids, and 
pyrimidines) tests. The remaining 35 (40%) are identified by specific 
tests and molecular analysis. A digital app (TIDE BC) is freely available 
(http://www.treatable-­id.org) and provides an information portal about 
these diseases and their treatments. Although the yield from metabolic 
studies in “nonsyndromic” GDD/ID is relatively low (0.2–2.5%), IEMs 
are amenable to treatment, so metabolic testing should be considered in 
all cases of unexplained GDD/ID.

Developmental regression is important to differentiate from ID as it 
implies an active or ongoing process resulting in neurologic degen­
eration. Red flags for potentially life-­threatening metabolic disorders 
include vomiting, intractable seizures, unexplained lethargy, or altered 
mental status. Tables 28.2 and 28.3 provide further clues for the treat­
ing provider. Recognition of treatable disorders allows for timely inter­
vention and will impact long-­term outcomes (http://www.treatable-­id.
