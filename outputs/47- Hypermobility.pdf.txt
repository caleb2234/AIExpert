It is estimated that up to 25% of the population reports the presence 
of joint hypermobility, but a quarter of the population does not have 
an associated connective tissue disorder, nor is the increased mobility 
deemed a health concern; nonetheless, hypermobility may be associ­
ated with a connective tissue disorder. In addition, there is a vast spec­
trum of comorbidities attributed to the presence of hypermobility (Fig. 
47.1 and Table 47.1).
EVALUATING HYPERMOBILITY
There have been several methodologies used to accurately define the 
presence of joint hypermobility; the most universally accepted method 
is the Beighton score (Fig. 47.2 and Tables 47.2 and 47.3). Possible 
reasons for the estimated high incidence of hypermobility in the gen­
eral population is the incorrect application of the criteria listed in the 
Beighton score or not applying the relevant age-appropriate adjust­
ment to the score (see Table 47.3). It is important to strictly adhere 
to the guide in Fig. 47.2 and to use a goniometer to ensure accurate 
measurement of joint angles. Patients tend to overestimate their own 
hypermobility; one should avoid unnecessary diagnostic evaluations 
that might not add value to the purpose of assessing the underlying 
etiology of the presenting symptoms. The Beighton score has typically 
been reserved for children older than 6 years of age because it may be 
unreliable in younger children who have a propensity for natural joint 
hypermobility. One revision of the Beighton score that includes ankle 
dorsiflexion has been reported as a reliable indicator for children up to 
the age of 5 years.
CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND ITS ROLE IN THESE 
DISORDERS
The structural integrity of connective tissues ensures normal artic­
ular surfaces, normal bone structure and strength, normal tendon 
insertion, and both macroscopic and microscopic support for mus­
cles. The range of disorders involving primary connective tissue 
integrity extends from bone dysplasia, muscle dystrophy, and myop­
athy to the more well-recognized hereditary disorders of connective 
tissue such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Table 47.4). Hypermobility 
is also a common feature seen in chromosomal aneuploidies and 
neurodevelopmental syndromes such as Down syndrome. A review 
of a commonly used database for matching phenotypes with syn­
dromic traits identified >500 entries spanning these broad groups 
within the differential diagnostic consideration for hypermobility 
(Table 47.5).
The functional impact of disregulating connective tissues is nei­
ther well characterized nor well understood. There is recognition 
that functional disorders co-segregate with disorders that impact con­
nective tissues. Functional gastrointestinal disorders (constipation, 
gastroparesis, bloating, and pain) as well as dysautonomia in the car­
diovascular system (orthostatic intolerance, tachy-/bradycardias) are 
frequently documented complaints and their presence often triggers 
the evaluation for hypermobility or a more diffuse underlying con­
nective tissue disorder. The range of common symptoms frequently 
associated with hypermobility is detailed in Table 47.1 and Figs. 47.3, 
47.4, 47.5, and 47.6.
Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders
The classification of hypermobility as a disease has undergone numer­
ous changes, with the emphasis being discerning “benign famil­
ial hypermobility” from more serious connective tissue disorders. 
The most recent of these classifications is derived from the Interna­
tional Consortium on the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes meeting in 2017 
(Table 47.6).
This classification for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 
(hEDS) has been criticized for being too restrictive because several 
individuals who previously met clinical diagnosis based on the Ville­
franche classification no longer meet these criteria despite a family 
history supporting the diagnosis. There are good reasons for this 
more restrictive diagnosis given the clinical pleiotropy of associated 
symptoms (see Table 47.1) and lack of a defining molecular diagnosis. 
It is widely believed that hEDS is not a single disorder but represents 
the involvement of several gene pathways. This does not help the cli­
nician because there are more individuals who are diagnosed with 
hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) who share complex medical 
histories. Utilization of the 5-point hypermobility questionnaire can 
be helpful in identifying affected patients with a history of hypermo­
bility (Table 47.7).
The age and gender at diagnosis vary and tend to favor females 
through puberty and young adulthood. There is often a preceding sig­
nificant life event such as a motor vehicle crash or injury, hospitaliza­
tion for an infection, or some other significant medical issue. It is not 
clear how this relates to the clinical manifestation, either as a trigger 
for closer medical inspection or a true epigenetic phenomenon that 
initiates a cascade with an evolving phenotype.
DIAGNOSTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF 
HYPERMOBILITY
The evaluation of hypermobility extends beyond the joints. A detailed 
head-to-toe evaluation is necessary to assess for possible syndromic dis­
orders (see Chapter 29), primary neuromuscular disorders, and other 
chameleons or mimics that overlap with the primary hypermobility

spectrum disorders. The algorithm illustrated in Fig. 47.7 provides a 
framework for approaching the diagnostic evaluation for a patient with 
generalized joint hypermobility.
The primary differential diagnoses for hypermobility are other 
forms of hereditary connective tissue disorders. These are detailed in 
Tables 47.5 and 47.8 (see also Table 29.10 for Marfan syndrome) in 
addition to the individual syndrome-defining characteristics.
There is a broad range of disorders to consider in the differential 
when assessing hypermobility (Table 47.9). In the context of syndromic 
hypermobility (i.e., in association with learning difficulties, dysmor­
phisms, or major malformations), it is important to refer to a genetics 
specialty service so that additional evaluation and testing can be con­
sidered. Similarly, if muscle weakness or suspicion for a bone dysplasia 
is suspected, those patients should be further evaluated by a specialist 
with expertise in the field.
CLOSING CONSIDERATIONS
The presentation of a young adolescent with chronic fatigue, dysau­
tonomia, or diffuse or regional pain syndromes in the presence of 
hypermobility requires careful consideration. These nonspecific symp­
tom complexes can overlap with hEDS, syndromic disorders such as

Fig. 47.1  Schematization of the novel terminology introduced by the 
new nosology of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and joint hypermobility. 
The two-dimensional variability is represented by the vertical (patho­
genesis) and horizontal (etiology) lines. In the middle are the relation­
ships between the domains of asymptomatic joint hypermobilities and 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Generalized joint hypermobility and hyper­
mobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are highlighted as the closest phe­
notypes within the corresponding domains. Pleiotropy is the concept 
bridging the two domains. Below them is the “realm” of the hyper­
mobility spectrum disorders. Hypermobility spectrum disorders group 
together all those phenotypes presenting joint hypermobility plus one 
or more of its secondary manifestations but not satisfying the criteria 
for any Ehlers-Danlos syndrome variant, also comprising the hypermo­
bile type. Above the two domains is the wide spectrum of joint hyper­
mobility–related comorbidities that may occur in all the phenotypes 
lying beneath. Joint hypermobility–related comorbidities comprise an 
expanding group of common disorders (i.e., psychological distress, 
functional gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular dysautonomia, and 
pelvic prolapses—not otherwise defined) that show a statistical associ­
ation with joint hypermobility, but their etiopathogenesis is complicated 
by a variety of acquired factors.

Fig. 47.7  Diagnostic approach for a patient with generalized joint hypermobility (JH). JH without associated 
musculoskeletal and syndromic manifestation should be considered a benign and common trait. In the pres­
ence of systemic involvement, possible scenarios include specific/common phenotypes (see Table 47.9). 
Once all other partially overlapping conditions have been excluded, the presence of musculoskeletal mani­
festations in the absence of appreciable systemic involvement prompts a diagnosis of HSD. If the conditions 
for hEDS are met (see Table 47.7), then a clinical diagnosis of hEDS is made; no molecular testing required. 
When a well-defined HCT is suspected, additional testing in the form of CVS imaging and molecular testing 
can formalize the diagnosis. The final scenario refers to JH phenotypes with overt syndromic association in 
the absence of a clearly identifiable Mendelian disorder. In these cases, additional testing is directed by the 
presence of dysmorphic features, ASD, or ID. ASD, autism spectrum disorder; HCT, hereditary disorders of

Noonan syndrome, myopathies, metabolic disorders including dis­
orders of energy (mitochondrial) metabolism, or creatine uptake 
disorders. A detailed history of exacerbating circumstances can help 
define some of these disease mimics along with appropriate serum 
and biochemical testing or consideration for gene sequencing. Spe­
cialist referral is often necessary to help guide the evaluation, but it is 
the primary care physician who recognizes and initiates many of these 
investigations.
