DEFINITIONS
Vomiting/emesis is a protective reflex in response to a variety of stim­
uli that results in forceful ejection of stomach contents. The emetic 
reflex is complex and composed of three sequential events. Initially 
there is a prodromal phase characterized by nausea and autonomic 
changes, followed by retching and finally vomiting or forceful expul­
sion of gastric contents through the oral cavity. These events may occur 
independent of each other. In some cases, nausea may not progress to 
vomiting, while vomiting may occur without preceding nausea.
Nausea is defined as a vague, unpleasant epigastric or abdominal 
sensation that presents in a wavelike pattern and is associated with 
a feeling of imminent vomiting. Nausea is accompanied by a variety 
of autonomic changes including increases in salivation, diaphoresis, 
pupillary dilation, tachycardia, and changes in respiration. The gastro­
intestinal (GI) motor response during nausea comprises inhibition of 
spontaneous contractions of the GI tract, relaxation of the proximal 
stomach, and contraction of the esophageal longitudinal muscle, which 
pulls the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and proximal stomach into 
the thoracic cavity. This is followed by a retrograde peristaltic contrac­
tion from the small intestine to the gastric antrum called the retrograde 
giant contraction, which propels duodenal contents into the stomach.
Retching is defined as strong, involuntary efforts to vomit, which 
may be seen as preparatory maneuvers to vomiting. These efforts con­
sist of spasmodic contractions of the diaphragm and abdominal wall, 
resulting in increased abdominal pressure and decreased intrathoracic 
pressure, facilitating the relaxed LES and dilated proximal stomach to 
slide further into the thoracic cavity. This enables the free flow of gas­
tric content into the esophagus though this material may be returned to 
the stomach by secondary (nonswallow) esophageal peristalsis result­
ing in a to-­and-­fro movement.
Vomiting (emesis) differs from retching in that gastric content is 
expelled from the mouth. This is fostered by relaxation of the diaphragm 
and reversal of intrathoracic pressure from negative to positive, leading 
to increase of intraluminal pressure in the esophagus. It is accompanied 
by relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter and closure of the glottis.
Regurgitation is considered a form of gastroesophageal reflux and 
should be differentiated from vomiting. It is characterized by nonforceful 
expulsion of gastric content through the oral cavity, and as such, is caused 
predominantly by transient LES relaxations. It is generally not accompa­
nied by prodromal symptoms or retching. Although apparently effort­
less, it may be triggered by contractions of abdominal wall musculature 
as occurs in rumination syndrome. This propulsion perhaps distinguishes 
regurgitant from nonregurgitant reflux, which remains in the esophagus.
NEUROANATOMY OF VOMITING
The emetic reflex consists of an afferent limb (receptor and pathway), 
central integration and control, and an efferent limb (pathway and 
effector). The diverse afferent pathways may originate within the oro­
pharynx, GI tract, renal system, vestibular system, or central nervous 
system (e.g., hypothalamus, cortex). These afferent pathways can be 
triggered by various stimuli including visceral pain and inflammation, 
toxins, motion, pregnancy, radiation exposure, postoperative states, 
and unpleasant emotions. Tactile stimulation to the back of the throat 
can also stimulate emesis. Mechanoreceptors located in the muscularis 
layer of the GI tract can trigger the emetic reflex in response to pas­
sive distension and strong contractions as seen in cases of mechanical 
obstruction. Chemoreceptors located in the mucosa of the stomach 
and proximal small bowel can be stimulated by a wide array of chemi­
cal irritants and toxins, leading to emesis. Similarly, such receptors can 
be found in other organ systems such as the pelvic ureteral system, 
which can induce emesis in response to distension, irritation, and other 
insults.
The afferent pathways originating from the GI tract are principally 
mediated via vagal afferent fibers. Vomiting in response to drugs and 
toxins circulating in the blood is thought to be mediated via the “che­
moreceptive trigger zone” in the area postrema located on the dorsal 
surface of the floor of the fourth ventricle outside the blood-­brain bar­
rier. Substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid can be detected by 
chemosensitive receptors in this area. Activation of the afferent limb of 
the vomiting reflex may also occur through real or apparent motion of 
the body. This occurs when the brain receives conflicting information 
about body movement from the visual, vestibular, and propriocep­
tive systems, referred to as “sensory mismatch.” Higher cortical areas 
(supramedullary) can also induce vomiting in response to central ner­
vous system diseases and emotional stress via cortical afferent nerves.
The afferent pathways terminate centrally in the nucleus tractus sol­
itarius (NTS) and the surrounding reticular area located in the dorso­
lateral medulla. The NTS is the beginning of the final common pathway 
by which all emetic pathways are thought to induce vomiting. The NTS 
signals to the emetic central pattern generator (CPG). Contrary to past 
beliefs, there is no isolated central “vomiting center” but rather a group 
of loosely organized neurons scattered throughout the medulla that 
need to be activated in an appropriate sequence by the CPG to control 
the bodily functions associated with emesis. In the final step, the ste­
reotypical motor response of vomiting is generated and is mediated by 
efferent fibers in the vagal, phrenic, and spinal nerves.
NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS OF VOMITING
A wide variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are involved in 
the vomiting reflex. The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area 
postrema contains receptors for dopamine (D2-­receptor), serotonin 
(5HT-­3), histamine (H1), substance P (neurokinin-­1 [NK-­1]), acetyl­
choline (muscarinic), and opioid (μ and δ). These receptors are meant 
to detect the presence of the associated neurotransmitter in the blood 
and at a certain level will activate the emetic pathway.

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Serotonin receptors (5HT-­3) are also found in the vagal affer­
ent fibers of the GI tract, and evidence suggests that chemothera­
peutic agents, radiation, and noxious stimuli act directly on these 
GI tract vagal fibers, inducing the release of serotonin. Substance 
P and its receptor (NK-­1) are widely distributed in the central and 
peripheral nervous system, and blockade of this receptor prevents 
emesis due to both central and peripheral stimuli. Animal models 
have demonstrated that physical and psychological stress can trig­
ger the release of corticotropin-­releasing hormone, which acts via 
the CRF-­2 receptor located in the brainstem to induce emesis and 
mediate gastric stasis.

and intestinal duplications may be discovered at any age. Other 
important etiologies of vomiting to consider in the neonatal period 
are inborn errors of metabolism and sepsis. Older infants presenting 
with vomiting may have less severe structural or metabolic disorders, 
or they may have common acquired disorders such as gastroenteritis, 
mild systemic infections, gastroesophageal reflux, or allergies. Some 
metabolic disorders first manifest in older infants when novel dietary 
introductions expose them to provocative foods. Gastroenteritis and 
other infections are important considerations in these younger patients 
with relatively naïve immune systems. Toddlers frequently experience 
repeated episodes of gastroenteritis due to a variety of infectious organ­
isms. Although gastroenteritis may initially present with emesis, there 
is usually both vomiting and diarrhea and, depending on the patho­
gen, abdominal pain. Vomiting in the absence of diarrhea should suggest 
another etiology. However, this age group also presents with acquired 
obstructive GI disorders such as intussusception or volvulus or with 
vomiting caused by ingested poisons.
Throughout childhood and adolescence, a wide variety of acquired 
disorders become symptomatic, and more subtle congenital malfor­
mations may also first become evident at these older ages. Metabolic 
disorders continue to be an important but infrequent cause of recur­
rent vomiting throughout childhood. In adolescents, pregnancy, drug 
ingestion, chronic marijuana use, and eating disorders should be added 
to the diagnostic considerations.
Temporal Pattern of Vomiting
Vomiting may be acute or recurrent. The recurrent pattern can be 
categorized as chronic recurrent or cyclic recurrent (Fig. 15.1 and 
Table 15.2). Differential diagnoses based on temporal pattern of vom­
iting are extensive (Tables 15.3 and 15.4). Acute vomiting is the most 
common pattern encountered in the pediatric population due to the 
frequent nature of infectious triggers. Acute causes of emesis usually 
present with multiple episodes of emesis per day, lasting for a few 
days, and may result in dehydration. This can also be encountered 
in association with acute GI obstructions, food poisoning, or toxin 
ingestion as well as an acute rise in intracranial pressure as seen with 
encephalitis or intracranial space-­occupying lesions. The recurrent 
pattern of vomiting can be chronic, low grade, characterized by one 
to two episodes of emesis per day. These patients are generally mildly 
ill and not dehydrated.
About 30% of recurrent emesis manifests with a cyclic pattern as in 
cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). This presents with intermittent epi­
sodes of high-­frequency vomiting interspersed with periods of normal 
health. Episodes are often stereotypical and associated with pallor, list­
lessness, and dehydration. In those with a chronic emesis pattern, the GI 
causes exceed the non-­GI causes by 7:1. The most common etiologies

period. The acute pattern is represented by a single episode of moderate 
vomiting intensity; the chronic pattern by a recurrent low-­grade vomiting 
pattern that occurs on a daily basis; and the cyclic pattern by recurrent, 
discrete episodes of high-­intensity vomiting that occur once every sev­
eral weeks with normal health in between. (From Mokha J. Vomiting and

of chronic emesis include GI mucosal inflammation or defects such 
as eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and Crohn 
disease, but psychobehavioral causes such as rumination and bulimia 
nervosa should be kept in mind. On the contrary, the diagnostic profile 
of cyclic vomiting is reversed with a ratio of non-­GI causes outnum­
bering GI causes by 5:1. While CVS is the most common cause of this 
pattern, an episodic pattern of vomiting can also be a manifestation 
of renal (e.g., acute hydronephrosis from ureteropelvic obstruction), 
endocrine (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, Addison disease), or metabolic 
disorders (e.g., mitochondrial, fatty acid oxidation defects).
Characteristics of Vomiting
The contents of the vomitus narrow the diagnostic possibilities. 
Hematemesis and bilious vomiting, in particular, are approached in a 
manner very different from that of vomiting without these characteris­
tics and may represent more serious underlying disorders (see Chapter 
16). Effortless vomiting is witnessed in reflux and rumination, while 
more forceful vomiting is often noted with upper GI tract obstruction, 
CVS, and toxins.
Associated Symptoms
Temporal associations of vomiting with specific time of the day, rela­
tion to meals, intake of specific foods, and other inciting events can 
give important diagnostic clues (see Table 15.4). Of all the causes of 
early morning emesis, the most worrisome is increased intracranial 
pressure. More common causes of early morning nausea and vomit­
ing are CVS, dysautonomia, and chronic sinusitis with postnasal drip. 
Pregnancy should be ruled out in all sexually active females. Post-­tussive 
emesis should direct diagnostic attention to the cause of the cough 
itself. Food vomited many hours after its consumption is suspicious for 
delayed gastric emptying or gastric outlet obstruction. Episodic vom­
iting associated with abdominal pain precipitated after consumption 
of a large quantity of fluids and resolving after diuresis can be a result 
of intermittent hydronephrosis caused by ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) 
obstruction.
Associated symptoms (Table 15.5) can be crucial in differentiating 
serious life-­threatening conditions that require urgent intervention 
from the more benign causes of vomiting. Vomiting with neurologic 
signs such as headache, altered sensorium, and seizures should alert 
providers to consider intracranial or metabolic disorders. Abdominal 
pain is a central symptom associated with vomiting and its character 
and location can further help narrow the diagnosis (see Chapter 13). 
Abdominal pain can be categorized as visceral, parietal, or referred 
pain. Visceral pain is caused by excessive contraction, distension, 
inflammation, or ischemia of the walls of hollow viscera (stomach, 
intestines, bile duct, ureter) or the capsule of solid organs (liver, spleen, 
kidney). Patients usually have difficulty describing visceral pain. It can 
be dull, intermittent, vague, or colicky and is poorly localized, often 
to the midline. Common examples are pain secondary to infectious 
gastroenteritis, functional abdominal pain disorders, toxic irritation, 
intestinal obstruction, etc. Parietal pain is sharp, constant, and well 
localized to the area of the underlying problem. It signifies inflamma­
tion of the contiguous peritoneum. It is exacerbated with movement, 
is associated with localized tenderness on examination, and requires 
immediate medical attention. Parietal pain is present in conditions 
such as acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, and perforation 
of viscus. Referred pain describes pain perceived in an area remote 
from the site of the inciting pathologic process. Abdominal pain may 
therefore be a symptom of disease localized in the thorax, pelvis, or 
retroperitoneum.
When suspecting a psychosocial cause of vomiting, providers 
should inquire about anxiety, binge eating, body image, and any recent 
stressors. Minor head injury can also present as vomiting in children, 
especially toddlers. There is evidence to suggest that vomiting after a 
minor head injury may be related to intrinsic patient factors rather 
than the severity of the injury. Vomiting that is persistent or latent in 
onset may be more likely to signify head injury. Emesis following a 
recent history of blunt abdominal trauma should raise the suspicion of 
a duodenal hematoma.
Medical, Family, and Social History
Previous surgery, hospitalizations, and medications may provide 
important clues. A family history of fetal or neonatal deaths suggests a 
genetic or metabolic cause; similar illness in family members or other 
contacts may suggest infections or common toxic exposures. Psycho­
social stressors may be found in adolescents with bulimia, peptic ulcer 
disease, chronic marijuana use, or intentional self-­poisonings.
Physical Examination
Although vomiting is a “gastrointestinal” symptom, it can be a 
manifestation of disease in multiple systems of the body (see Table 
15.5). Vital signs identify fever, which is important in narrowing the

differential diagnosis. Tachypnea may signify pneumonia or a met­
abolic acidosis, which is seen with vomiting from inborn errors of 
metabolism or poisoning. Intense vomiting as seen with infection, 
toxin ingestion, cyclic vomiting, or a possible surgical emergency can 
present with signs of severe dehydration or hypovolemic shock. Pres­
ence of failure to thrive or chronic malnutrition can be suggestive of 
malabsorption syndromes or metabolic conditions. A thorough neu­
rologic exam including examination of optic fundi is warranted in all 
patients. The absence of venous pulsations or sharp optic disc margins 
may be the only evidence of a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion 
causing vomiting. When in doubt, a formal ophthalmologic examina­
tion is warranted.
Abdominal Examination
Simple observation of operative scars may suggest the possibility of 
obstruction from intestinal adhesions, and visible distention may rep­
resent ascites caused by liver disease or intraluminal distention caused 
by intestinal obstruction or ileus. The order of the examination is 
important because auscultation performed after stimulation of intesti­
nal motility by palpation may artifactually change the auscultatory find­
ings. An important distinction in the vomiting child is whether bowel 
sounds are increased, as in gastroenteritis or in bowel obstructions, or 
absent, as in ileus caused by peritonitis or in chronic intestinal pseudo-­
obstruction. Increased bowel sounds resulting from luminal obstruc­
tion are often characterized by intermittent “rushes” of high-­pitched

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
sounds that are coordinated with episodes of colicky pain. Although 
seen infrequently, visible peristalsis in infants and a succussion splash 
in children are indications of a gastric outlet obstruction that is causing 
gastric distension and retention of fluid. Palpate the abdomen and pel­
vis for area of tenderness and signs of peritoneal inflammation as they 
often represent disorders necessitating further imaging and/or surgery. 
Also palpate for presence of organomegaly and abdominal masses. 
Hepatosplenomegaly can be found in various metabolic or inflamma­
tory diseases. Abdominal masses can be congenital (e.g., mesenteric 
cyst) or acquired (e.g., neuroblastoma) and result in bowel obstruction 
(see Chapter 20). Examine genitalia and hernia sites for ambiguous 
genitalia, ovarian/testicular torsion, and strangulated hernias. Vague 
periumbilical pain is quite nonspecific, but the localized, very sharp 
pain signifying inflammation of the peritoneum requires immediate 
attention. Initial luminal obstruction may progress to ileus as perito­
nitis intervenes. Localization of nonperiumbilical pain or tenderness 
helps a great deal in determining the diseased intraabdominal organ 
(see Table 15.5).
Rectal Examination
A rectal examination may be helpful in the vomiting child as the 
presence and consistency of rectal stool may be determined. A large 
fecal impaction may possibly contribute to vomiting in some young 
children. Pelvic masses and tenderness identified by rectal exam may 
represent appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or pelvic inflammatory disease. 
The stool should always be tested for blood and should be considered 
for testing for pH, reducing substances, fat, leukocytes, and infectious 
organisms, depending on the presentation.
Evaluation
The evaluation of a patient with vomiting is usually performed in a 
primary care or emergency department setting. Initial evaluation is 
directed at assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation as well as 
hydration status. Clinically diagnosed dehydration without any labo­
ratory confirmation is usually a sufficient basis to initiate rehydration 
therapy. Look for the presence of red flag signs (Table 15.6) that suggest 
more ominous causes of vomiting. If the physical examination reveals 
signs of acute abdomen (bilious emesis, peritonitis, shock), obtain­
ing abdominal imaging and seeking urgent surgical consultation are 
indicated. Presence of brisk hematemesis warrants an urgent gastroen­
terology consult. Altered mental status suggests toxin ingestion, inborn 
errors of metabolism, acquired metabolic conditions such as hyperam­
monemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and neurologic causes.
Laboratory Data
Well-­appearing infants with typical regurgitant reflux usually require 
no laboratory evaluation, except possibly a GI contrast study if they 
do not respond readily to conservative therapy (see later discussion). 
Similarly, a single, brief episode of mild vomiting with no suggestion 
of dehydration or other complications may necessitate no laboratory 
studies. Most children with presumed infectious gastroenteritis or 
colitis do not need to undergo microbiologic stool testing to identify 
underlying pathogens since these are self-­limiting conditions. Other 
children, those with severe acute vomiting or with chronic or recurrent 
vomiting, should have screening studies of blood or urine (Table 15.7). 
Presence of glucose and ketones in urine suggests diabetic ketoacido­
sis; red blood cells suggest a renal cause (nephritis, Henoch-­Schönlein 
purpura, renal calculi, or trauma); and leukocytes or nitrites suggest a 
urinary tract infection. Screening blood investigations should include 
a total blood count, blood sugar, serum electrolytes, blood gases, liver 
enzymes, lipase, and renal function tests. Elevated leucocyte count sug­
gests presence of infection or inflammation; anemia could be second­
ary to chronic malabsorption, occult GI losses, or a hemolytic process 
such as hemolytic uremic syndrome. Typical electrolyte abnormalities

occur in an infant with projectile vomiting from pyloric stenosis (hypo­
chloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis) and congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia or Addison disease (hyperkalemia and hyponatremia). 
Blood and urine screening for several metabolic disorders are positive 
only during an actual vomiting episode; therefore, when suspecting a 
metabolic cause, attempts should be made to obtain specimens at these 
times, which may increase the diagnostic yield. Metabolic work-­up 
includes acid-­base, serum ammonia and lactate, serum and urine car­
nitine (possible fatty acid oxidation defect), serum amino acids (pos­
sible aminoacidemia), urine organic acids (possible organic acidemia), 
and urine aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogens (possible acute 
intermittent porphyria) (Table 15.8).
Radiographic and Procedure Data
If the history and physical examination suggest the possibility of 
abdominal disease, endoscopic evaluation or abdominal plain films 
(including a second image such as an upright film) are usually war­
ranted (Table 15.9). Endoscopy is particularly useful in hematemesis, 
in suspected peptic ulcer disease, or when tissue is needed for histo­
logic study (e.g., establishing a diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori gastritis 
or of eosinophilic gastroenteropathy). Radiographic testing is useful 
in most other situations. Further evaluation, such as contrast studies, 
ultrasonography, CT, or MRI, is tailored to the suspected diagnoses. 
In some cases, manometric evaluation is prompted by the sugges­
tion of GI motility disorders, such as achalasia and chronic intestinal 
pseudo-­obstruction.

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Differential Diagnosis
General Approach
Cardinal symptoms or signs accompanying the vomiting direct the 
differential diagnosis. When vomiting is a result of intraabdominal 
disease, it is useful to define whether obstruction, dysmotility, inflam­
mation, or ischemia is the mechanism. Abdominal pain, which fre­
quently accompanies vomiting, can suggest both the type of disorder 
and the organ involved (see Table 15.5). Symptoms referable to non-­GI 
organ systems direct attention to those systems. For example, accom­
panying neurologic symptoms may direct attention to central nervous 
system disorders, metabolic disease, poisonings, or psychobehavioral 
disease.
Gastrointestinal Obstruction (Table 15.10)
Esophageal Obstruction
Esophageal strictures or obstruction produces dysphagia with welling 
up or drooling of oropharyngeal secretions or esophageal contents 
rather than actual vomiting; the material is undigested. Respiratory 
symptoms from aspiration may be prominent.
Esophageal Atresia
Esophageal atresia is a congenital malformation defined by the discon­
tinuity of the esophagus. Infants present at birth with a prenatal history 
of polyhydramnios and intolerance of initial feeding. The esophageal 
atresia is accompanied by a distal tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) in 
85% of cases, by a proximal fistula in a small percentage, and by no fis­
tula in the remainder (Fig. 15.2). Esophageal atresia is associated with 
other anomalies in 15–50% of patients; cardiac, anorectal, and genito­
urinary defects are most common. Ten percent of all esophageal atresia 
patients and 25% of those without a fistula have the VATER or VAC­
TERL (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, radial, 
limb) association. As many as 33% of affected infants are premature. 
Diagnosis can usually be made by plain films after passage of an opaque 
rubber catheter, which coils in the upper pouch (Fig. 15.3). Treatment 
is surgical.
Congenital Esophageal Stenosis
Congenital esophageal stenosis is defined as an intrinsic narrowing of 
the esophagus present at birth. Infants usually tolerate breast-­feeding 
and start to present with vomiting and regurgitation with the intro­
duction of semisolid or solid food. A milder degree of stenosis may 
not present until later in childhood. Stenoses are categorized into three 
histopathologic types: tracheobronchial remnants that often contain 
cartilage, fibromuscular stenoses, and membranous webs. Contrast 
radiography can diagnose the first two, while endoscopy is needed to 
diagnose webs. Tracheobronchial rings generally necessitate surgery, 
membranous webs can be treated with endoscopic dilation, and mus­
cular stenoses may respond to dilation or may necessitate surgery.
Esophageal Strictures
Esophageal strictures (Fig. 15.4) are acquired lesions that can be cate­
gorized as inflammatory (secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease 
[GERD] and eosinophilic esophagitis), anastomotic (post-­TEF repair), 
or related to corrosive injury (acid, alkali, pills, battery ingestions). The 
clinical presentation is the same for all these conditions: patients pri­
marily present with dysphagia, recurrent vomiting, or food impaction. 
The strictures are best demonstrated with contrast radiography; endo­
scopic biopsies may be important for diagnosis of the etiology. GERD 
may be treated pharmacologically but may also require an antireflux 
surgery (fundoplication). Endoscopic dilation of the stricture is per­
formed repeatedly with balloons or semirigid bougies until the stric­
tured site remains patent.
Miscellaneous Causes
Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric problem with up to 75% 
of cases in children age 4 years or younger. Coins are the most com­
monly ingested foreign body. The esophagus, in particular the upper 
one third, is a common site for obstruction. Patients may present with 
drooling, vomiting, cough, and stridor, and if lodged in the esophagus, 
urgent endoscopic removal is required.
Extrinsic esophageal compression may result from an aberrant 
subclavian artery, vascular ring, and mediastinal masses (lymphoma,

germ cell tumors). Vascular rings occur when the esophagus and tra­
chea are encircled, displaced, or compressed by the aorta or its aberrant 
branches and can present with stridor, dysphagia, and emesis. It is often 
an incidental finding on chest x-­ray. In symptomatic cases, even after 
a vascular ring has been detected by plain radiography or esophagog­
raphy, advanced cross-­sectional imaging is recommended for more 
detailed evaluation.
Gastric Outlet Obstruction
Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is the most common cause of 
gastric outlet obstruction in infancy with an incidence rate of 1:400 
infants. It manifests with nonbilious projectile vomiting beginning at 
2–3 weeks of age and increasing during the next month or so, usually 
in a first-born male child. The vomitus may rarely contain some blood, 
and propulsive gastric waves can be seen across the abdominal wall. 
Dehydration, poor weight gain, hypochloremic hypokalemic meta­
bolic alkalosis, and mild jaundice are sometimes evident. A palpable 
“olive” in the epigastrium (felt best during or after feeding) represents 
the hypertrophied pyloric muscle. Gastric distention is seen on the 
plain film, and a contrast study shows the “string sign” of contrast pass­
ing through the narrowed pyloric channel. Ultrasound diagnosis is less 
invasive and demonstrates increase of the pyloric channel length and 
muscle thickness (Fig. 15.5). Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy is the treat­
ment of choice. Preoperative correction of dehydration and electrolyte 
imbalance reduces perioperative morbidity. Junctional epidermolysis 
bullosum is associated with pyloric stenosis.
Other Causes of Gastric Outlet Obstruction
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can mimic clinical signs and ultrasound 
appearance of HPS. Clues to diagnosis are eosinophilic infiltrate of 
endoscopic antral biopsies, peripheral eosinophilia, and an excellent 
response to treatment with a casein hydrolysate or elemental “hypoal­
lergenic” formula. Prolonged use of prostaglandin infusion in neonates 
with congenital heart disease may cause transient HPS. The clinical and 
radiologic features of HPS are relieved after stopping prostaglandin E 
infusion.
In older children, gastric outlet obstruction may result from chronic 
peptic ulcer disease, chronic granulomatous disease, gastroduodenal 
Crohn disease, anatomic abnormalities such as gastric antral web, for­
eign bodies, and bezoars. Bezoars may be caused by hair, vegetable 
matter, milk curds, or medications. Contrast radiography, endoscopy, 
and, in some cases, histopathology is needed to make the diagnosis.
Intestinal Obstruction
The classical clinical tetrad is colicky abdominal pain, nausea and 
vomiting, abdominal distention, and constipation-­to-­obstipation. 
Examination may demonstrate a tympanic abdomen, hyperactive 
bowel sounds, and signs of dehydration. Severe direct tenderness, 
involuntary guarding, abdominal rigidity, and rebound tenderness 
suggest advanced intestinal obstruction, as do marked leukocytosis, 
neutrophilia, left shift, and lactic acidosis. Obstructions may be cate­
gorized by site and type (see Table 15.10). Vomiting is a cardinal sign 
of intestinal obstruction, being more prominent in high small bowel 
obstruction than in low small bowel or colon obstruction. With high 
obstructions, vomiting is not feculent, the onset is often acute, and 
crampy pain may occur at frequent intervals, while abdominal dis­
tention is less prominent. With low obstructions, the vomiting may 
be feculent and less acute in onset, the interval between cramping 
is longer, and distention is more notable. Identification of the site of 
obstruction is aided by the plain film and by other radiographic stud­
ies (see Table 15.9). Intraluminal lesions (e.g., tumors, intussuscep­
tions, or extrinsic material such as feces, foreign bodies, bezoars, and

gallstones) can be differentiated from bowel wall lesions (strictures, 
stenoses, atresias) and from extraluminal lesions (adhesions, congen­
ital bands, tumors, volvulus) through imaging. Radiographic studies 
are useful, beginning with the plain film and progressing to ultraso­
nography or CT. Abdominal CT with oral and intravenous contrast 
and fluoroscopy with contrast are both sensitive and specific in detect­
ing and characterizing intestinal obstruction. However, the decision to 
introduce contrast into an intestine that may perforate or be operated 
on must be made with surgical and radiologic consultation. Often the 
decision to operate can be made without certain identification of the 
lesion, and contrast studies are unnecessary.
Infantile bilious vomiting is an important symptom of intestinal 
obstruction, which often signals a congenital GI anomaly, particularly 
intestinal obstruction below the ampulla of Vater. Surgical consultation 
is needed early in these infants because they often require emergency 
therapy.
Duodenal Atresia, Stenosis, and Web; Annular Pancreas
The juxta-­ampullary duodenum is susceptible to a cluster of obstructing 
congenital anomalies. Infants with complete duodenal obstruction, most 
commonly atresia, present with bilious vomiting and a radiographic 
“double-­bubble” sign (Fig. 15.6). Associated prematurity (and polyhy­
dramnios) or anomalies, including renal, cardiac, and vertebral defects, 
occur in approximately 75% of infants; trisomy 21 is seen in about 50%. 
Double atresias, duplications, and malrotations are frequently seen. 
Infants with a partial duodenal obstruction caused by a stenosis or 
web may have such mild symptoms that they do not come to medical

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
attention until regurgitation produces esophagitis or until a foreign body 
or bezoar is trapped at the obstruction. Treatment is surgical.
Duodenal Hematoma
Blunt abdominal trauma (seatbelt, steering wheel, bicycle handle­
bar injury; child abuse), or even endoscopic biopsies in the context 
of a coagulopathy, can produce an obstructing duodenal hematoma. 
Endoscopy in the setting of stem cell transplantation or other hema­
topoietic disease may place a patient at greater risk of such hematoma, 
requiring special consideration of the need for duodenal biopsies 
in these individuals. Therapy is symptomatic; jejunal feeding that 
bypasses the obstruction or parenteral nutrition may be required as the 
problem resolves.
Jejunal Atresia, Ileal Atresia, and Ileal Stenosis
Patients with these congenital lesions present with bilious vomiting 
and more abdominal distention than those with duodenal lesions. The 
atresias are readily suspected and diagnosed in the neonatal period. 
Stenotic lesions may require radiography for diagnosis. Treatment is 
surgical.
Intestinal Strictures
Strictures produce partial obstruction of the GI tract and may be 
located anywhere from the esophagus to the anus. They may occur 
postsurgically (anastomotic), may follow necrotizing enterocolitis, may 
be caused by penetrating Crohn disease or intestinal graft versus host 
disease, or may be sequalae of drug-­induced ulcers (nonsteroidal anti­
inflammatory medications or high-­dose pancreatic enzymes). Some 
patients may be treated with endoscopic dilatation, but many require 
surgical stricturoplasty (opening the bowel longitudinally and closing 
it transversely) or resection.
Adhesions
Obstructive symptoms in the child with a history of prior abdominal 
surgery may be caused by adhesive bands.
Duplications
GI tract duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies and can occur in 
any portion of the GI tract but are more commonly encountered in the 
small intestine. These uncommon lesions may cause vomiting by extrin­
sic obstruction of the intestine or by intussusception. On examination, 
an abdominal mass may be palpable. Treatment is surgical resection.
Meconium Ileus and Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome
Approximately 20% of infants with cystic fibrosis present in the new­
born period with failure to pass meconium, caused by meconium 
ileus (MI). The sticky, poorly hydrated intestinal mucus plays a role. 
It can present in two forms: simple or complex MI. In simple MI, 
viscid meconium physically obstructs the terminal ileum and results 
in the dilation of the proximal small intestine. In complex MI, the 
meconium-­distended segments of ileum can give rise to complications 
like prenatal volvulus, ischemic necrosis, or perforation and extrusion 
of the meconium into the peritoneum. The classic “soap bubble” sign 
may be seen on abdominal x-­ray when meconium mixes with swal­
lowed air (Fig. 15.7).
Simple MI may be treated with hyperosmolar contrast (Gastrogra­
fin) enema performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Surgery is required 
for complex MI or those simple cases resistant to enema. Virtually all 
infants with MI have cystic fibrosis; the diagnosis should be confirmed 
by sweat test or DNA analysis.
Older children with cystic fibrosis who stop defecating and have 
abdominal pain and occasional vomiting are said to have distal 
intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS), formerly termed meco­
nium ileus equivalent. Initial treatment consists of rehydration, stool 
softening laxatives, or intestinal lavage and enemas. If not successful, 
then Gastrografin, administered orally or as enema often at times 
mixed with N-­acetylcysteine (mucolytic), is nearly always successful. 
Surgery is rarely required. Close attention to fluid and electrolyte bal­
ance is vital in all infants and children treated with a hyperosmolar 
contrast medium. Avoiding dehydration and optimizing pancreatic 
enzyme dosage may reduce the chance of further episodes.
Incarcerated Hernia
Whenever vomiting is accompanied by signs of obstruction, sites of 
potential herniation should be examined for incarceration of a loop 
of bowel (Fig. 15.8). Inguinal incarceration is most common, but 
other types of hernias are femoral, obturator, spigelian, umbilical (1 in 
1,500 incarcerate), epigastric, mesenteric, and postoperative incisional 
hernias.
Inguinal hernias are often reduced by gentle, firm, constant pres­
sure that is directed through the scrotum toward the inguinal canal. 
Sedation and the Trendelenburg position may facilitate reduction.
Malrotation and Volvulus
Volvulus is the twisting of a loop of bowel on the mesentery. Midgut 
volvulus occurs most often in the context of congenital intestinal mal­
rotation, in which the small intestine is not normally fastened in place. 
This may only be clinically apparent on upper GI fluoroscopy when the 
duodenum and distal small bowel are seen to fill with contrast right of 
midline without crossing to the left upper quadrant (Fig. 15.9). More 
than half of patients found to have malrotation present symptomati­
cally (the rest of such cases are discovered incidentally), and about half 
of the symptomatic patients present in the neonatal period with bilious 
vomiting caused by volvulus. Those presenting later often do not have 
bilious vomiting; the vomiting may be intermittent for years.
Volvulus is an extremely hazardous obstructing lesion. The luminal 
obstruction is closed at both ends, which leads to sepsis from rapidly 
proliferating and translocating bacteria. There is also vascular obstruc­
tion caused by the root of the mesentery getting twisted, which quickly 
produces ischemia of the small intestine. Even if volvulus is diagnosed 
and repaired promptly, massive intestinal resection may be necessary 
secondary to underlying necrosis; this produces short bowel syndrome. 
Because volvulus may be intermittent, it may produce episodic or

chronic intermittent vomiting or nonspecific abdominal pain before a 
lethal event. Therefore, upper intestinal contrast radiographs should be 
considered in all patients with intermittent vomiting, and surgery must 
be performed if a malrotation is found (i.e., if the ligament of Treitz is 
not to the left of the spine), even if volvulus is not present at the time 
of the examination. In an infant in whom an ongoing volvulus is sus­
pected, a contrast study may show a “volvulus/corkscrew” pattern (Fig. 
15.10). In the sick infant or child in whom volvulus seems likely, sur­
gery without contrast studies may be preferred. Surgery involves cor­
rection of any present volvulus, functional positioning of malrotation, 
and lysis of potentially obstructing peritoneal (Ladd) bands that cross 
the abdomen.
Other types of volvulus not associated with malrotation include 
cecal, sigmoid, and transverse colonic volvulus. They are less common 
in children and less apt to produce short bowel syndrome, but they too 
may manifest with vomiting and result in death if untreated. Sigmoid 
volvulus is sometimes treated nonoperatively via endoscopic release.
Meckel Diverticulum
Meckel diverticulum is a small intestinal diverticulum that represents 
the fibrous remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. Although painless 
GI bleed is the most common presentation, it can present as intestinal 
obstruction or inflammation (diverticulitis). It may lead to obstructive 
vomiting by causing intussusception (Fig. 15.11) or intestinal volvulus 
around the diverticular axis. It can get inflamed, leading to peritonitis

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
(mimics appendicitis or peptic ulcer disease) and sometimes perfo­
ration, which can induce vomiting. The “rule of 2s” identifies charac­
teristic findings: diverticula are present in 2% of the population; only 
2% are symptomatic; the male:female ratio is 2:1; the diverticula occur 
within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve and are 2 inches long; there are 2 
major types of heterotopic mucosa (gastric and pancreatic); and the 
condition is confused with 2 diseases (appendicitis and peptic ulcer). 
Treatment is surgical resection.
Intussusception
The normal function of the intestine is to constrict above and relax 
below an intraluminal bolus. When such a bolus (a “lead point”) is 
attached to the intestinal wall, the propulsive activity of the intestine 
produces telescoping of proximal intestine (intussusceptum) into distal 
intestine (intussuscipiens), causing both luminal obstruction and mes­
enteric vascular compromise (see Fig. 15.11). Abdominal pain occurs 
in nearly all children with intussusception, whereas vomiting results 
in about 65%, and “currant-­jelly stools” (from mucosal hemorrhage) 
occur in fewer than 20%. The pain is severe, crampy, and often con­
temporaneous with the vomiting. Between cramps, the child may be 
listless, may sleep, or may even play. Vomiting and bloody stools are 
more common in younger infants and in those with longer duration 
of symptoms. An abdominal mass is palpable in about 25% of patients.
The lead point of a symptomatic intussusception is usually ileal, 
producing intussusception that is ileocecal or ileocolonic. It is probable 
that prominent ileal lymphoid nodules provide the lead point for most 
young children presenting with intussusception, 66% of whom are 
younger than 2 years, with a peak incidence late in the first year of life. 
Other lead points to be considered are Meckel diverticulum, appendix, 
enteral duplication cyst, intraluminal polyp, lymphoma, hematoma 
from trauma, Henoch-­Schönlein purpura, or inspissated stool in cystic 
fibrosis. Transient recurrent small bowel intussusception may also be a 
feature of celiac disease.
Ultrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice for intussusception 
in children as it has a high sensitivity and specificity. In stable children 
without signs of peritonitis, nonoperative reduction is the treatment 
of choice, preferably with pneumatic (gas) reduction enema. Approxi­
mately 10% of patients experience recurrences.
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is caused by extrinsic 
compression of the duodenum, which is trapped between the SMA 
anteriorly and the aorta posteriorly as the SMA crosses over the duo­
denum in the root of the mesentery. The angle at which the SMA comes 
out from the aorta is normally 25–60 degrees; in people with SMA syn­
drome, this angle is reduced. Loss of the mesenteric fat pad normally 
found between these two arteries is the most common cause of reduc­
tion in the angle. Most affected individuals have recently undergone 
significant weight loss (anorexia nervosa, severe burns, neoplastic dis­
ease, malabsorptive states). Certain orthopedic surgeries (scoliosis cor­
rection) and treatments (hip spica, full body casts) as well as abdominal 
surgeries (total proctocolectomy and ileal J-­pouch anal anastomosis) 
can also trigger SMA syndrome.
Patients may present both acutely and insidiously, thus making 
the diagnosis challenging. Adolescents are most often affected with a 
female:male ratio of 3:2. It should be suspected in a patient with the 
aforementioned risk factor who presents with early satiety and post­
prandial abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious emesis. The pain is 
described as crampy and is relieved by prone or knee-­chest positions.
The traditional diagnostic test with barium contrast can be used to 
visualize the common but nonspecific image showing dilated proximal 
duodenum with breakup of barium in the distal third of the duode­
num. CT and MRA are the most valuable tests for diagnosing SMA 
syndrome as they are good at evaluating the aortomesenteric angle 
and provide other anatomic information. Nutritional rehabilitation, 
preferably by the enteral route via nasojejunal feeds, is the cornerstone 
of therapy and generally resolves SMA syndrome. The prone position 
may improve duodenal emptying. Surgery may be needed if there are 
chronic symptoms despite nutritional rehabilitation.
Constipation, Meconium Plug, and Anal Stenosis
These distal colonic problems produce obstipation primarily, but if 
they are severe and persistent, vomiting may result. Rectal examination 
provides the diagnosis. Enemas, laxatives, dietary changes, and behav­
ioral modification are useful in treating constipation, whereas surgery 
is usually necessary to treat anal atresia or stenosis. Infants with meco­
nium plug syndrome need clinical follow-­up to monitor for the pres­
ence of coexistent Hirschsprung disease.
Gastrointestinal Dysmotility
Achalasia
Achalasia is an uncommon esophageal dysmotility disorder character­
ized by emesis of undigested food from the esophagus and history of 
dysphagia to solids and liquids. Concurrent weight loss is common. The 
etiology is unknown, but some cases are familial and in other cases it 
may be part of the triple A syndrome (achalasia, adrenocorticotropic 
hormone–resistant adrenal insufficiency, alacrima). In endemic areas, 
Chagas disease should be considered. In addition, achalasia has been 
associated with trisomy 21, congenital hypoventilation syndrome, and 
familial dysautonomia. Contrast swallow study or esophagogram and 
preferably esophageal manometry are needed to confirm diagnosis. The 
classic finding on manometry is insufficient relaxation of the LES and 
loss of esophageal peristalsis. Barium swallow demonstrates esopha­
geal dilation, aperistalsis, poor emptying of contrast, and “bird-beak” 
appearance (Fig. 15.12). Nifedipine, sildenafil, and botulinum toxin 
have been reported to produce at least temporary clinical benefit in 
many patients. However, for sustained benefit, first-­line therapy is sur­
gical (Heller) myotomy or, in certain cases, pneumatic balloon dilation.

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Gastroesophageal Reflux
Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is defined as regurgitation of gastric con­
tents into the esophagus with or without vomiting. GER is of particular 
importance because (1) it is the most common cause of “vomiting” in 
infants, (2) physiologic reflux must be distinguished from reflux necessi­
tating evaluation and therapy, and (3) the practitioner must be vigilant to 
avoid misdiagnosing other infantile vomiting diseases as reflux.
Reflux typically is a benign feature in healthy infants as a result of 
weak LES tone, which improves and resolves in a predictable manner 
as a function of growth, development, acquiring upright positions, and 
introducing some solids in the diet. In these infants, regurgitation will 
be effortless and will not have associated failure to gain weight, feeding 
problems, or airway symptoms.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as GER that 
leads to troublesome symptoms and/or complications (Table 15.11). 
Reflux may cause failure to gain weight resulting from regurgitation of 
caloric feedings, odynophagia from esophagitis, or parental reluctance 
to feed a recurrently spitting infant.
Infants with more problematic regurgitant reflux should undergo 
upper GI radiography and/or ultrasonography to rule out the possibility 
of anatomic causes such as malrotation and gastric outlet obstruction 
such as from hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Endoscopy with biopsy is 
warranted in infants with anorexia and irritability who have failed opti­
mal therapies. An older child with atopic history and symptoms of reflux 
and/or failure of acid suppression therapy needs consideration of endos­
copy to rule out alternative causes such as eosinophilic esophagitis. A 
pH impedance study can be considered if persistent troublesome symp­
toms correlate with feedings/reflux events. However, such tests should 
be performed with caution as a significant degree of reflux is physiologic 
and there is insufficient normative data in infants and children.
Management of regurgitant reflux in infants is outlined in Figure 
15.13. First-­line therapy includes modifying feed volume and fre­
quency according to age of infant to avoid overfeeding. Thickening of 
the feeds with 1 tablespoon of dry rice cereal per ounce of formula 
helps reduce symptoms. Breast-­feeding mothers can pump breast milk 
and add thickeners. Positional therapy and probiotics are not univer­
sally recommended because of a lack of data on efficacy. If symptoms 
persist after the aforementioned measures, a 2–4-­week empiric trial of a 
protein hydrolysate or elemental formula should be attempted for cow’s 
milk protein allergy since there is a high degree of symptom overlap 
with GERD. Breast-­feeding mothers will need to eliminate dairy from 
their diet. If symptoms do not respond to the aforementioned mea­
sures, a referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is warranted. If timely 
referral is not possible, a 4–8-­week, time-limited trial with an oral H2-­
receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can be considered 
in infants. Given increased knowledge of side effects from chronic acid 
suppression and insufficient randomized controlled data to support its 
use, empiric acid suppression therapy for infants is not recommended 
based on expert consensus guidelines. As some benefit is demonstrated 
in older children with GERD, a short (4–8-­week) diagnostic trial of 
acid suppression therapy can be justified. It is important to avoid long-­
term use when possible and to initiate a wean if symptoms improve. 
Refractory GERD is defined as symptoms that do not respond to 4–8 
weeks of acid suppression therapy and requires exclusion of alternative 
diagnoses and evaluation of treatment efficacy.
The rare child who does not improve and develops nutritional, 
respiratory, or peptic complications from reflux may deserve evalua­
tion for surgical fundoplication if all other therapies fail and excessive 
reflux is documented by pH impedance study (Fig. 15.14).

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation

This anchors the lower esophageal sphincter below the diaphragm.
Gastroparesis
Gastroparesis is characterized by delayed transit of gastric contents 
into the duodenum in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It is sug­
gested by the vomiting of food eaten hours earlier and accompanied 
by abdominal pain and nausea. Diabetic gastroparesis, secondary to 
autonomic neuropathy and gastric atony, is the classic example of this 
disorder but is rare in childhood. The etiology in pediatrics is often idio­
pathic but among the known causes, postinfectious gastroparesis is the 
most common. Respiratory and GI viruses are implicated, most nota­
bly rotavirus, norovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-­Barr virus, and var­
icella. Other etiologies of gastroparesis in children include autonomic 
nervous system (ANS) disorders, connective tissue (Ehlers-­Danlos) 
or mitochondrial disorders, muscular dystrophies, inflammatory con­
ditions (cow’s milk protein allergy, celiac disease), critical illness, and 
medications (e.g., anticholinergics). Certain anatomic abnormalities 
(repaired congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intestinal malrotation) 
are associated with gastroparesis. An upper GI contrast study should 
be performed to rule out mechanical obstruction. The 4-­hour gastric 
emptying scintigraphy using a radiolabeled solid meal is currently the 
gold standard for diagnosing gastroparesis. This test needs to be used 
with caution as there are no pediatric norms to interpret results against.
Pharmacotherapy with prokinetic medications (e.g., erythromycin, 
metoclopramide) along with dietary modification is the first line of 
treatment.
Ileus
Paralytic ileus is defined as functional obstruction caused by paralysis of 
intestinal muscles in response to various stimuli. The common causes of 
paralytic ileus are postoperative state, following an episode of infectious 
gastroenteritis, sepsis, peritonitis, or intestinal ischemia. Other causes 
of paralytic ileus are drugs (narcotics, laxative abuse, anticholinergics), 
electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypercalcemia), endocrinopa­
thies (hypothyroidism), status post-­chemo-­ or radiotherapy, or injuries 
(spinal fractures). Intestinal contents fail to progress, causing abdominal 
pain and vomiting. Typically, the bowel sounds are decreased or absent; 
there may be abdominal distention. Signs of ileus may follow signs of 
intestinal obstruction; in this context, ileus is an ominous sign. Treatment 
of ileus requires correction of any correctable provocative abnormalities 
and nasogastric tube decompression until normal peristalsis resumes.
Intestinal Pseudo-­obstruction
Chronic pediatric intestinal pseudo-­obstruction (PIPO) is a rare dis­
order defined by either continuous or intermittent symptoms of bowel 
obstruction in the absence of a lumen-­occluding lesion (see Chapter 19). 
It represents severe GI dysmotility where coordinated peristalsis in the 
intestinal tract becomes altered or inefficient. Its chronicity sets it apart 
from the far more common acute paralytic ileus. PIPO can be catego­
rized into two broad categories: congenital and acquired, which has been 
further subdivided histologically as myopathic vs neuropathic types.
Most congenital subtypes are sporadic, while family history is 
present in 20–30%. The myopathic causes (10%) include myositis or 
muscle fibrosis secondary to collagen vascular disease (e.g., progressive 
systemic sclerosis), various muscular dystrophies, and familial visceral 
myopathies. The neuropathic causes (90%) include Hirschsprung dis­
ease, Chagas disease, diabetic and other autonomic neuropathies, mul­
tiple endocrine neoplasia, and familial visceral neuropathies.
The disorder may involve any part of or the entire luminal GI tract 
and occasionally (in up to 10% of patients) involves the urinary tract. 
Common symptoms of PIPO include abdominal pain and distension, 
nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Symptoms can worsen during 
acute exacerbations of pseudo-­obstruction, which can be triggered by 
viral or bacterial infections, general anesthesia, psychological stress, 
and malnutrition. Nearly 65% of the children with PIPO present in 
infancy, with the very severe cases presenting in the neonatal period. 
Antenatal ultrasound may show polyhydramnios, megacystis, and dis­
tended bowel loops.
To accurately diagnose PIPO, imaging studies and manometry eval­
uation are generally required. Antroduodenal and colon manometry 
studies can evaluate the strength and coordination of contractions of the 
gastric antrum, small bowel, and colon. The main value of manometry 
testing is to confirm diagnosis/predict prognosis and to help differenti­
ate between myopathic and neuropathic lesions. Histologic evaluation 
of full-­thickness biopsies and genetic testing can aid in diagnosis. Small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a common complication of chron­
ically dilated bowel and is associated with steatorrhea and fat-­soluble 
vitamin and vitamin B12 deficiency and can be treated with judicious 
use of antibiotics. PIPO patients are at increased risk of chronic mal­
nutrition, which is contributed by recurrent vomiting, bacterial over­
growth–induced malabsorption, and intolerance to enteral feeds.
Promotility agents (metoclopramide, erythromycin, pyridostigmine) 
can be helpful, but pharmacotherapy is often ineffective. Intensive nutri­
tional rehabilitation, via both enteral and parenteral routes, remains the 
cornerstone of therapy. Children with poor quality of life despite appro­
priate medical management or those who have developed complications 
of parenteral nutrition are candidates for intestinal transplantation.
Gastrointestinal Inflammation
Esophagitis
Esophagitis may be associated with vomiting in the setting of eosino­
philic esophagitis (EoE), where patients may also experience nausea 
and/or dysphagia. With regard to reflux disease, esophagitis is second­
ary to vomiting.

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Gastroenteritis
Gastroenteritis is a frequent cause of acute vomiting illness in child­
hood and frequently associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, or 
fever. Rotavirus, especially in infants, is notable for its prominent 
vomiting, which often precedes the diarrhea. “Food poisoning” also 
produces vomiting and diarrhea, often caused by bacterially derived 
toxin. The novel coronavirus COVID-­19 has also been associated with 
gastroenteritis. Microbiologic investigations may be considered in chil­
dren with underlying chronic conditions or immunodeficiencies (e.g., 
oncologic diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.), in those with 
severe symptoms or bloody diarrhea, or in those with prolonged symp­
toms in whom specific treatment is considered.
Treatment of acute gastroenteritis mandates attention to hydration 
and supportive care. Oral rehydration is feasible in many children with 
gastroenteritis, but a common error is to use clear liquids longer than 
24 hours; this leaves nutritional needs unmet. Early refeeding in gas­
troenteritis is most successful when the food is low in fat and lactose 
and high in complex carbohydrates.
Acid Peptic Disease
Acid peptic disease includes gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenitis, and duo­
denal ulcer. In contrast to adults, these disorders frequently cause vom­
iting in association with abdominal pain in pediatrics. The acidic gastric 
contents, which normally aid in digestion, become corrosive when 
there is an increase in acid production or a disruption of protective fac­
tors such as a mucous layer, a pH-­neutral buffer zone, an epithelial layer, 
and a rich gastric blood supply. Defined causes for acid peptic disease 
include infections (H. pylori infection being the most well recognized), 
bile reflux gastritis, medication induced (nonsteroidal antiinflamma­
tory agents, high-­dose corticosteroids, etc.), and rare gastrin-­secreting 
tumors (Zollinger-­Ellison syndrome). Stress ulcers occur in the context 
of sepsis, burns, surgery, head trauma, and severe acute illness.
The optimal diagnostic method is endoscopy, with evaluation for 
H. pylori or elevated gastrin in appropriate cases. Acid suppression is 
the preferred treatment. H. pylori infections are treated with evolving 
regimens of triple antibiotics plus acid suppression drugs; eradica­
tion rate is approximately 85% for most treatments. Zollinger-­Ellison 
syndrome is optimally treated by tumor resection and evaluation for 
related endocrine tumors; PPI treatment is helpful if complete tumor 
resection is impossible. Complications of acid peptic disease include 
GI bleeding, intestinal perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction.
Meckel Diverticulitis
In addition to presenting as GI bleeding or obstruction, Meckel diver­
ticula may become inflamed and mimic appendicitis. Treatment is sur­
gical and further information about Meckel diverticulum is discussed 
previously.
Mesenteric Adenitis
Mesenteric adenitis is often found on CT scans and refers to inflam­
mation of lymph nodes in the mesentery. It is probably caused by viral 
(adenovirus, measles) or bacterial (Yersinia enterocolitica) infection, 
but the symptoms are similar enough to appendicitis that the diagnosis 
is usually not made before surgery. Ultrasonography can readily distin­
guish mesenteric adenitis from appendicitis.
Appendicitis
When vomiting occurs in appendicitis, it follows the periumbilical pain 
but may precede the localization of the pain to the McBurney point, two 
thirds of the way between the umbilicus and the right anterior iliac spine. 
Before perforation, there is only occasional vomiting. After perforation, 
the fever may be higher; the child lies still with the right hip flexed, and 
vomiting may be more frequent and feculent. In appendicitis, there is 
later vomiting, less diarrhea, fewer bowel sounds, and more rectal or 
rebound tenderness than in gastroenteritis. It is also associated with 
less diarrhea, less fever, and less leukocytosis than is bacterial enteritis, 
although Yersinia, in particular, has caused right lower quadrant pain 
closely mimicking appendicitis. Crohn disease is usually more chronic 
than is appendicitis but sometimes is diagnosed by surgeons at the time 
of appendectomy based on serosal changes to the bowel.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Crohn disease, in particular, may produce vomiting on occasion, partic­
ularly when obstructing intestinal strictures develop. Other extraintesti­
nal manifestations of Crohn disease also, in rare cases, produce vomiting.
Allergic Enteropathy, Eosinophilic Gastroenteropathy, and 
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Vomiting is a frequent response to ingestion of allergens and may occur as 
early as the first weeks of life in infants with allergy (non–immunoglobu­
lin E [IgE] or IgE mediated) to cow’s milk or soy and in older children as 
potentially allergenic foods are introduced. There may be associated diar­
rhea and hematochezia and, in some children, urticaria or other systemic 
signs of allergy. A strong family history of allergic disorders is suggestive. 
Laboratory studies may show peripheral blood eosinophilia and positive 
radioallergosorbent test (serum-­specific IgE) to individual foods.
In infants, the simplest diagnostic test is a change to a protein hydro­
lysate or elemental formula for at least 2 weeks. In breast-­fed infants, 
the mother should start a strict dairy-­free diet. If the vomiting (and 
other symptoms) resolves, it is generally not necessary to rechallenge 
for diagnosis, but empirical treatment can be continued for several 
months. Because infants usually outgrow these formula protein intol­
erances between 10 and 24 months of age, a normal diet can later be 
introduced as tolerated. Older children with vomiting that represents 
IgE-­mediated food allergy or eosinophilic gastroenteropathy are less 
likely to outgrow the allergy over time.
IgE-­mediated food allergy has a rapid onset of symptoms after 
exposure to allergic food and reaction can vary from mild to severe, 
with anaphylaxis being the most severe form. The diagnosis of IgE-­
mediated food allergy requires a history of classic clinical symptoms 
and evidence of food-­specific IgE by either skin-­prick or serum-­
specific IgE testing. Eosinophilic GI diseases, on the other hand, are a 
group of chronic inflammatory conditions characterized histologically 
by eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract and varying degree of vil­
lous injury. It is composed of EoE, eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic 
gastroenteritis, or eosinophilic colitis. Diagnosis is made by endoscopy 
with biopsies. EoE may occur independently of eosinophilic gastro­
enteropathy and should be kept in mind, particularly with patients 
manifesting dysphagia or reflux symptoms poorly responsive to stan­
dard therapy. At endoscopy, the esophageal mucosa displays a ringed 
or furrowed appearance with granularity (Fig. 15.15), with pathology 
specimens confirming a high eosinophil cell count.
If sensitization to particular foods is identified through radioaller­
gosorbent (serum-­specific IgE testing) or skin testing, an elimination 
diet is employed; patients with prohibitive numbers of food allergies 
may require an amino acid–based diet. Steroids may be necessary for 
children with negative investigation findings for food allergy or for 
whom compliance with a restricted diet is problematic.
Similarly, celiac disease (i.e., gluten enteropathy) may present with 
chronic vomiting in association with other GI symptoms, most com­
monly abdominal pain, bloating, and altered stool habits. Diagnosis 
is made by serum tissue transglutaminase (TTG) and total IgA level 
(as IgA-­deficient individuals may have a falsely normal TTG) and con­
firmed by endoscopic duodenal biopsies.

Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders
Functional GI disorders, also known as disorders of gut-­brain inter­
action, are highly prevalent and among the most common conditions 
referred to GI subspecialists. In the absence of specific biomarkers 
or tests, functional GI disorders are diagnosed clinically when, after 
appropriate medical evaluation, symptoms cannot be attributed to 
another medical condition. They are thought to arise from aberrant 
gut-­brain signaling as a result of complex interplay of various biopsy­
chosocial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. Functional 
nausea and vomiting disorders form a separate category defined by 
the Rome IV expert consensus criteria. This category includes CVS, 
functional nausea and functional vomiting, rumination syndrome, and 
aerophagia.
Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome
CVS is a chronic, potentially disabling condition marked by a history 
of three or more bouts of intense, acute nausea and vomiting that may 
last hours or days, punctuated by entirely symptom-­free intervals last­
ing weeks to months (Table 15.12). Work-­up, which may ultimately 
include endoscopy and imaging studies of the GI tract, urinary tract, 
and brain, reveals no evidence of significant underlying primary dis­
ease. Mean age of presentation is 5 years. CVS has a distinctive pattern 
of emesis, which is essential for diagnosis (see Fig. 15.15). The vomit­
ing episodes are discrete, recurrent, and relentless as well as stereotyp­
ical in each patient as to time of onset (often early morning), duration 
(hours or days), and symptoms (pallor, listlessness). Four phases are 
described: the prodromal phase, the emetic phase, the recovery phase, 
and the interepisodic or asymptomatic phase. The prodromal phase is 
characterized by nausea, pallor, diaphoresis, fatigue, insomnia, and a 
sense of impending attack. This is the optimal time to intervene with 
rescue therapies to prevent progression to the emetic cascade. The 
emetic phase heralds with emesis that is frequent, is forceful, may 
contain bile or blood, and is associated with intractable nausea, which 
is relieved only with deep sleep. Other features include listlessness, 
pallor, drooling, diarrhea, dizziness, and diaphoresis. About 50% of 
cases demonstrate photophobia and phonophobia, and a majority are 
associated with abdominal pain. CVS is associated with poor quality 
of life with as many as 58% of children with CVS requiring intrave­
nous fluids during episodes and an average of 10 visits to the emer­
gency department annually. An inciting event such as an infection, 
emotional excitement, negative stress, or lack of sleep can be identified 
in 80% of patients.
The pathophysiologic process of CVS remains speculative at 
this time but, at least in a subset, may overlap with that of migraine 
disorders. One hypothesis purports that stress-­initiated release of 
corticotropin-­releasing hormone leads to cascading production of sub­
stances, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, antidiuretic hormone, 
histamine, and catecholamines, which in turn mediates the signs and 
symptoms. Some children may harbor subclinical defects in mitochon­
drial fatty acid oxidation metabolism or neuronal ion channel func­
tion that heighten their susceptibility to attacks when confronted by 
the increased cellular energy needs created by a physiologic or emo­
tional stressor. A baseline ANS dysfunction is also reported in the liter­
ature. Although CVS is well recognized, the provider needs to remain 
vigilant to other treatable, “look-­alike” organic conditions. Reported 
cases of organic disease mislabeled as “cyclic vomiting” have included 
intermittent intussusception or volvulus caused by enteric duplication, 
diverticulum, or malrotation; increased intracranial pressure; toxic 
or metabolic disease; obstructive uropathy; porphyria; and familial 
dysautonomia. Medications potentially useful in CVS prophylaxis and 
in treatment of acute episodes are listed in Table 15.13.
Abdominal Migraine
Abdominal migraine is a periodic syndrome similar to CVS and 
included in the Rome IV functional abdominal pain disorders cate­
gory (in addition to functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, 
and functional abdominal pain—not otherwise specified). Abdominal

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
migraine is characterized by paroxysmal episodes of intense perium­
bilical, midline, or diffuse abdominal pain. The episodes are associated 
with intense nausea, vomiting, anorexia, pallor, headache, or photo­
phobia. A pathophysiologic overlap with CVS and migraine headache 
is proposed based on similar symptom pattern and response to therapy. 
When these abdominal symptoms coexist with head pain, a diagnosis 
of migraine headache is made. Similarly, if the predominant symptom 
is emesis, CVS is the most accurate diagnostic term. Although there is a 
high degree of overlap, the predominant and most consistent symptom 
during episodes defines the illness. Most evolve into typical migraine 
headaches during preteen years, and by age 18 years, 75% have tran­
sitioned their symptoms for migraine headaches. Usually, isolated 
abdominal migraine attacks occur suddenly, last an hour to days, and, 
as in CVS, are consistent in character within the same individual. There 
is usually a family history of migraine, and patients are asymptomatic 
between attacks. A personal history of car (motion) sickness may be 
present. Therapy is similar to CVS. Abortive therapy is composed of 
triptans, while prophylactic antimigraine medications such as propran­
olol, cyproheptadine, or amitriptyline often help prevent attacks.
Functional Vomiting
Functional vomiting refers to chronic, recurrent vomiting at least once 
per week that is not self-­induced and occurs in the absence of eating dis­
orders, major psychiatric diseases, or other medical diseases. The absence 
of organic causes illustrates the prominent influence that cortical and psy­
chologic inputs may have in stimulating nausea and vomiting. The pro­
posed features of functional vomiting include chronicity, association with 
stress, absence of cachexia or anorexia, and commonly relief by hospital­
ization or higher-­level care. An example would be of a child who involun­
tarily vomits every time before a school test or on Monday mornings due 
to heightened anxiety but is otherwise well and recovers when the stressor 
is absent. Although a clear relationship with gastric motor disorders such 
as gastroparesis has not been established due to lack of diagnostic tests, 
these conditions may overlap and complicate management. Close evalua­
tion of specific clinical features such as emesis of undigested food and sig­
nificant postprandial distress as occurs in gastroparesis is essential prior 
to committing to a diagnosis of functional vomiting.
Rumination Syndrome
Rumination syndrome is characterized by repeated, effortless food 
regurgitation during or soon after eating (generally within 15 min­
utes), followed by rechewing, reswallowing, or spitting out the 
regurgitant. This syndrome can be disabling and lead to medical 
complications (weight loss, electrolyte imbalance) and, even more 
so, significant functional limitations and psychosocial stigma (school 
absenteeism, avoiding social eating). The regurgitation behavior is a 
habit/reflex that arises as a conditioned response to certain stimuli 
(e.g., particular foods, environments, activities). It is hypothesized 
that prior to the act of regurgitation, patients feel a premonitory urge 
often described as a visceral sensation (e.g., abdominal pressure). To 
relieve the urge, the patient regurgitates by contracting the abdom­
inal wall muscles. Once the material is brought up, the premonitory 
urge temporarily subsides, leading to relaxation of abdominal mus­
cles. Other clinical features include general lack of retching and nau­
sea as well as absence of symptoms during sleep. Patients sometimes 
recognize an inciting event retrospectively (e.g., a respiratory or GI 
infection, psychosocial stressor, or medical procedure). The disorder 
tends to cluster more in patients with underlying anxiety, adolescent 
girls, and children with autism spectrum disorders. In infants and 
intellectually disabled individuals, rumination can have a positive 
function of alleviating anxiety and is recognized as a self-­soothing

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
mechanism. Treatment may be challenging and focuses on behav­
ioral therapy of unlearning the conditioned rumination behavior. 
Successful therapy often requires multidisciplinary care in special­
ized treatment centers.
Functional Dyspepsia
Functional dyspepsia is characterized by chronic postprandial fullness, 
early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Although part of the func­
tional abdominal pain disorders category, postprandial nausea is often 
severe and patients may have intermittent emesis. The clinical features 
overlap significantly with those of gastroparesis and these conditions 
may be difficult to distinguish. However, dyspeptic patients tend to 
have postprandial emesis in closer temporal association with the meal 
as opposed to gastroparesis, where emesis is generally delayed.
Gastrointestinal Ischemia and Vascular Insufficiency
Some of the causes of GI ischemia can produce perforation, peritonitis, 
and death quite rapidly. A high degree of suspicion is useful because 
the signs are nonspecific.
Vasculitis
Inflammation of the mesenteric vessels is uncommon but may cause 
GI complaints, including vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and GI 
bleeding. Henoch-­Schönlein purpura is the most common pediatric 
vasculitis. Systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polyarte­
ritis nodosa, adenosine deaminase-­2 (ADA-­2) deficiency, and other 
hypersensitivity vasculitides are occasional causes. The most diagnos­
tic sign of Henoch-­Schönlein purpura is the palpable purpuric rash, 
typically found on the buttocks, posterior legs, and feet in 97% of 
patients. However, because the vomiting or hematemesis and the non­
specific abdominal pain (found in nearly 90%) may precede the rash, 
the diagnosis may initially be obscure. Repeated examination of the 
skin of a child with persistent vomiting and pain is therefore useful, 
particularly when the GI symptoms are accompanied by polyarthritis, 
which occurs in 65% of such patients. Platelet function and coagulation 
studies are normal; hematuria is often present. Steroids may shorten 
the abdominal pain by 1 or 2 days, but they might also mask symptoms 
of accompanying intussusception or perforation.
Mesenteric Ischemia
The mesenteric arteries may be occluded by emboli from a diseased heart 
or from thrombi formed locally. Nonocclusive ischemia may be caused 
by poor cardiac output, hypotension, dehydration, or endotoxemia. Mes­
enteric venous occlusion is very rare. Severe, crampy, diffuse abdominal 
pain may be accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. If no 
interventions are taken, the crampy pain becomes continuous and gan­
grene, peritonitis, and shock set in. Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion 
may be preceded by chronic symptoms of “abdominal angina,” which are 
episodes of several hours of crampy pain beginning about 20 minutes 
after meals. Such premonitory symptoms in suggestive settings (heart 
disease, inherited thrombophilia) should receive serious attention and 
require mesenteric and celiac angiography and emergency surgery.
Hepatobiliary Disorders
Hepatitis
The presence of acute viral hepatitis is usually suspected in patients who 
have jaundice, but up to 50% of patients with hepatitis A are anicteric, 
and even those in whom jaundice develops have a pre-­icteric prodrome 
lasting up to a week. In children with acute hepatitis, therefore, the 
presenting symptom may be vomiting, another reason for including 
liver enzymes in the screening evaluation of the ill-­appearing vomiting 
child. The vomiting is often accompanied by fatigue, fever, headache, 
rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough.
The findings of serum antigens and antibodies to hepatitis viruses 
establish the diagnosis. Acute hepatitis with vomiting is treated symp­
tomatically. Management also includes watching for the ominous find­
ings of progressive encephalopathy, ascites, and coagulopathy.
Biliary Colic and Cholecystitis
Biliary obstruction produces vomiting and abdominal pain in children. 
Biliary colic is visceral pain resulting from transient obstruction of the 
cystic duct, usually by a gallstone. Biliary colic produces several hours 
of steady, vaguely localized pain, often in the right upper quadrant; 
most patients also have vomiting. Episodes of biliary colic commonly 
recur at unpredictable intervals, from weeks to months. Acute chole­
cystitis may ensue if the obstruction persists and leads to inflamma­
tion of the gallbladder. The pain may localize more clearly to the right 
upper quadrant and may radiate to the back or shoulder. There may be 
fever or mild jaundice. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate ami­
notransferase, γ-­glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin levels may be elevated. In both biliary colic and acute chole­
cystitis, abdominal films and ultrasonography may disclose stones or 
gallbladder thickening. Common bile duct stones may produce con­
current elevations of liver enzymes and pancreatic enzymes. Recurrent 
biliary colic and cholecystitis are managed by cholecystectomy, which 
can be performed laparoscopically in many children. Endoscopic 
removal of common bile duct stones is also possible, although it does 
not prevent recurrence.
Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis is usually associated with epigastric abdominal pain, 
which may radiate to the back and may have associated emesis. Ele­
vated serum amylase and lipase levels usually confirm the diagnosis.
Gynecologic and Urologic Disorders
Pyelonephritis
High fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and, less often, diarrhea develop 
rapidly. There may be symptoms of cystitis with dysuria, frequency, 
urgency, and suprapubic pain. Costovertebral angle tenderness focuses 
the diagnosis to the urinary tract. The UA shows pyuria and bacteriuria, 
and the hemogram shows leukocytosis. Treatment is with antibiotics.
Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction and Hydronephrosis
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction is the most common congenital 
anomaly affecting the urinary tract and is often detected on antenatal 
ultrasound. It is more common in males and 60–90% cases are uni­
lateral. It is caused by intrinsic stenosis of the proximal ureter at the 
ureteropelvic junction and less commonly by an extrinsic compression 
(aberrant accessory renal artery).
Congenital cases are usually diagnosed in the first year of life 
(usually on the basis of a renal hydronephrotic mass or urinary tract 
infection). About 10–30% of affected older children present with 
intermittent, acute painful episodes referred to as “Dietl crisis” that 
are characterized by flank or periumbilical pain, which is frequently 
accompanied by vomiting. Given the episodic nature, the clinical pre­
sentation may mimic CVS.
Typically, symptoms commence in the evening after an increased 
fluid intake, although the hyperhydration history is often unclear. The 
child’s pain and vomiting usually remit spontaneously in several hours, 
as dehydration gradually relieves the renal pelvic distention. Superim­
posed unilateral urinary tract infection may cause additional findings 
of fever, failure to thrive, and pyuria. Ultrasonography at the time of 
an episode demonstrates hydronephrosis and provides the diagnosis. 
Once hydronephrosis is confirmed, diuretic renography (radionuclide 
scan) is ordered to assess the degree of obstruction as well as the level 
of renal function. The treatment is surgical.

286
SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
Renal Colic
Passage of a renal stone usually causes more pain than vomiting. Lat­
eralized colicky pain, hematuria, and confirmatory radiologic studies 
assist the diagnosis.
Dysmenorrhea, Endometriosis, and Pelvic Inflammatory 
Disease
These gynecologic disorders manifest with lower abdominal pain but 
only occasionally with vomiting. Association with menses or vaginal 
discharge aids the diagnosis. Cervical motion exacerbates the pain in 
pelvic inflammatory disease.
Ovarian Torsion
Torsion of a normal ovary occasionally occurs in girls of any age, prob­
ably caused by laxity of adnexal supports. Repeated attacks of crampy, 
lower abdominal pain culminate in a final acute episode with severe 
retching and vomiting, an enlarged ovarian mass, and eventual signs of 
peritonitis. Leukocytosis may be accompanied by fever. The location of 
the pain suggests the diagnosis, and the treatment is surgical.
Hyperemesis Gravidarum
Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe and prolonged form of nausea 
and vomiting thought to be caused by increased level of circulating 
β-­human chorionic gonadotropin (β-­HCG) during early pregnancy. 
All pubertal adolescent females with symptoms should be tested for 
pregnancy.
Testicular Torsion
Testicular torsion is a vascular emergency. It is readily diagnosed by the 
site of pain; surgical treatment is required.
Respiratory Disorders
Sinusitis, Pharyngitis, and Otitis
Sinusitis may induce chronic, unexplained vomiting. The vomiting is 
more apt to occur in the morning and must be differentiated from seri­
ous intracranial processes. It is usually characterized by a cough-­vomit 
cycle. Sinus tenderness and sinus CT scans suggest the diagnosis, and a 
successful trial of antibiotic therapy confirms it. Less often, pharyngitis 
or otitis media may manifest acutely with nonspecific vomiting.
Pneumonia
Emesis along with respiratory signs/symptoms may be a manifestation 
of pneumonia. As pneumonia can also be caused by vomiting second­
ary to aspiration, it is important to consider the direction of causality 
in children with pneumonia and vomiting. Aspiration of vomitus is 
particularly likely to occur in the context of obtundation or other neu­
rologic dysfunction.
Central Nervous System Disorders
Increased Intracranial Pressure
Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) could be secondary to a brain 
parenchymal lesion (e.g., tumor), vascular malformations, hydroceph­
alus (e.g., Arnold-­Chiari malformation, shunt malfunction), or central 
nervous system infection or be idiopathic (e.g., pseudotumor cerebri). 
It presents with headaches, vomiting, diplopia, and irritability. The 
vomiting is typically described as projectile, not associated with retch­
ing, and occurs more commonly upon awakening.
A careful neurologic and ophthalmologic examination may show 
decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, papilledema, and sixth cra­
nial nerve palsy. General exam should include measurement of blood 
pressure, occipitofrontal head circumference, and body mass index 
(BMI). Relevant radiologic studies (CT or MR scans) should help the 
examiner make the diagnosis.
Pseudotumor cerebri (meaning “false brain tumor”), also known 
as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is the presence of high ICP 
in the absence of any space-­occupying lesion. It is diagnosed by the 
presence of high opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure on lumbar 
puncture and an otherwise normal CSF analysis and neuroimaging. It 
is almost always associated with papilledema. Pseudotumor cerebri is 
more common in obese adolescent females. In most cases, the etiol­
ogy is unidentifiable, but at times, a secondary cause may be identified. 
Secondary causes include medication induced (tetracyclines, oral con­
traceptive pills, chemotherapeutic agents, steroids), endocrine disor­
ders such as hypoparathyroidism, Addison disease, growth hormone 
therapy, and nutritional disorders such as hypo-­ or hypervitaminosis 
A as well as refeeding syndrome. Optic atrophy and visual impairment 
are the most serious long-­term complications. Underlying causes, if 
identified, should be treated (weight loss, discontinuing medication). 
Acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) is an effective medica­
tion and works by decreasing CSF production. In some cases, removal 
of CSF by repeated lumbar puncture may be necessary to reduce ICP 
and resolve symptoms.
Occlusion or infection of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may produce 
vomiting on a neurologic basis, whereas the intraabdominal end of the 
shunt may provoke intestinal obstruction by volvulus, adhesions, or 
loculations. These possibilities must be kept in mind for the vomiting 
patient with a shunt.
Abdominal Epilepsy
Abdominal epilepsy is an uncommon cause of recurrent abdominal 
pain. It is characterized by paroxysmal episodes of abdominal pain, 
diverse GI complaints (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating), 
and central nervous system manifestations such as headache, dizzi­
ness, confusion, or temporary blindness. Although symptoms overlap 
strongly with those of abdominal migraines, patients with abdominal 
epilepsy have definite EEG abnormalities (generally the temporal area) 
and favorable response to anticonvulsant therapy.
Vestibular Disorders, Motion Sickness
Motion sickness is a common experience. Vestibular disorders pro­
duce similar symptoms. Because of the symptoms of nausea, nystag­
mus, vertigo, and dizziness, the diagnosis is usually obvious. Acute 
unilateral vestibular neuritis is a common diagnosis in children and 
occurs in association with respiratory viral infections and is self-­
limited. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are particularly useful 
for motion sickness.
Psychobehavioral Disorders
Eating Disorders
Anorexia and bulimia nervosa are eating disorders associated with 
purging behavior such as self-­induced vomiting and laxative abuse. 
Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance associated with eating disor­
ders can negatively impact gastric motility and intestinal transit, which 
in turn can bolster typical symptoms of eating disorders such as loss 
of appetite, constipation, and bloating and therefore may benefit from 
prokinetic agents.
Psychiatric Disorders
GI symptoms including recurrent vomiting are not uncommon man­
ifestations of underlying psychiatric disorders including generalized 
anxiety, depression, bipolar disease, obsessive-­compulsive disorder, 
and post-­traumatic stress disorder. A careful history including trauma

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
and abuse screening is essential to help differentiate a psychiatric etiol­
ogy from anxiety and stress related to an unresolved medical condition.
Munchausen by Proxy
Although rare, providers should remain vigilant to the possibility of Mun­
chausen syndrome by proxy in cases of refractory vomiting along with 
other nonspecific GI symptoms and absence of findings. This is a mental 
health disorder in which a caregiver fabricates or causes illness in a child. 
Given the paucity of diagnostic tests and biomarkers for many functional 
and motility disorders of the GI tract, GI complaints are among the most 
common complaints reported in Munchausen by proxy. Red flags include 
an excessive number of normal investigations and procedures.
Management
Psychiatric and psychology consultation and therapy are often needed 
for eating disorders, rumination, functional vomiting, and psychiatric 
causes of recurrent emesis. Principles of behavior modification such as 
stress reduction techniques, cognitive-­behavioral therapy, and hypno­
therapy have proven beneficial. Biofeedback techniques such as dia­
phragmatic breathing have a therapeutic role in rumination syndrome.
Nasogastric or nasojejunal feedings can be used to guarantee 
nutritional rehabilitation if voluntary oral nutrition is not readily re-­
established. Such tube feedings may also provide the child with the 
incentive to return to oral nutrition. Refeeding syndrome should be 
monitored for.
Metabolic Disorders
Metabolic diseases that cause vomiting are difficult to diagnose because 
they are both rare and diverse. Their diagnosis and treatment, how­
ever, are crucial because of the potential for severe morbidity and death 
and their amenability to treatment. They are also important because 
of their relevance to genetic counseling as most metabolic disorders 
are hereditary on an autosomal recessive basis. Situations that should 
prompt consideration of metabolic diseases are listed in Table 15.8. The 
screening studies (see Table 15.7) should be done while the child is 
symptomatic.
Poisonings and Drugs
Most ingested poisons, and some absorbed by inhalation, skin contact, 
or intravenous administration, induce vomiting, which can be seen as 
a physiologic protection against harmful substances. Symptoms and 
signs of some of the most common pediatric poisonings along with 
laboratory findings and treatment are indicated in Table 15.14. Acute 
known poisonings, either accidental or intentional, are a management 
rather than diagnostic problem and a Poison Control Center or other 
toxicology resources are helpful.
Initial diagnostic evaluation can be directed by a careful search of 
the environment for poisonous items and by toxicology screens on 
blood, urine, vomitus, and stool; these materials should not be dis­
carded. A few agents, such as lead, cause chronic poisoning, manifested 
by vomiting, among other symptoms. Since it may be particularly dif­
ficult to suspect and treat these poisonings, an index of suspicion of 
poisoning is important in the chronically vomiting child. Cannabi­
noid (marijuana) hyperemesis syndrome is often seen in a previously 
well adolescent (no prior history of emesis or CVS), who is a chronic 
(∼ daily) heavy user of marijuana. Nausea and abdominal discomfort 
may precede the acute onset of emesis characterized by intense and 
frequent episodes often relieved by taking multiple warm showers. It 
resembles CVS and many patients have been misdiagnosed with CVS.
Hematemesis
Hematemesis is vomiting of blood, which may be obviously red or 
have the appearance of coffee grounds (see Chapter 16). The source 
of bleeding is usually the upper GI tract proximal to the ligament of 
Treitz. A rapid initial assessment of the actively bleeding child is man­
datory and includes checking circulation, airway, and breathing while 
establishing intravenous access. A quick focused history of bleeding 
disorders, liver disease, GI diseases, and ingestion of medications, espe­
cially nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or foreign bodies should 
be taken. On exam the presence of pallor and orthostatic changes could 
point toward significant blood loss, while presence of jaundice and 
hepatosplenomegaly suggests chronic liver disease. Endoscopic eval­
uation and therapy are often needed for children with hematemesis. 
Important causes of hematemesis are listed in Table 15.15.
Overall, peptic ulcer disease secondary to H. pylori is the most com­
mon cause of hematemesis in children. Etiologies such as stress gastri­
tis, vascular malformation, and coagulopathies are common in all age 
groups. In newborns, swallowed maternal blood (uterine, breast milk), 
trauma secondary to suction of nasogastric tube, and necrotizing 
enterocolitis need to be considered. In preschool children, peptic ulcer 
disease, foreign body, and caustic ingestion are important causes, while 
in older children and adolescents, premalignant lesions such as Bar­
rett esophagus, peptic ulcers, medication-­induced gastritis/ulcers, and 
Mallory-­Weiss tear should be considered. Variceal bleeding is uncom­
mon but serious. Gastric vascular malformations are rare, may lead to 
copious bleeding, and may be difficult to diagnose. Duplications are 
lined by gastric mucosa in 30% of affected patients. If they are located 
above the ligament of Treitz, they may cause hematemesis. Obstructive 
lesions such as pyloric stenosis and antral webs are occasionally associ­
ated with hematemesis. The metabolic and toxic (iron, salicylates, the­
ophylline, corrosives, isopropyl alcohol, mushroom poisoning) causes 
of hematemesis should be kept in mind.
Therapy of hematemesis includes, as needed, correction of any 
abnormalities of coagulation: stabilization of hemodynamic status and 
direct attention to the bleeding site by hemostasis endoscopically (e.g., 
heater probe, injection therapy) or surgically. Reduction of gastric acid 
secretion pharmacologically is useful in virtually all cases of hematem­
esis and carries minimal risk.
Other Causes of Vomiting
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy causes predictable vomiting, which is usually not a 
diagnostic but a management problem. It may be complicated by antici­
patory vomiting. The theories hypothesized for chemotherapy-­induced 
vomiting are direct GI mucosal insult leading to release of serotonin 
or activation of receptors located in the area postrema by the circulat­
ing drug. Factors known to increase the incidence of chemotherapy-­
induced vomiting include younger age, female gender, emetogenicity 
of the chemotherapy agent, higher dose, and rate of administration.
The cornerstone of treatment is 5HT-­3 and NK-­1 receptor antag­
onists. Steroids, cannabinoids, and anxiolytics may also be beneficial.
Radiation Therapy
Like chemotherapy, radiation therapy may cause acute vomiting. It 
is thought to be caused by release of various neurotransmitters that 
activate the emetogenic reflex. Subacutely, diarrhea predominates as 
a complication of radiation therapy. Months to years later, vomiting 
may again be a result of radiation therapy, often caused by inflamma­
tory ulcers and strictures. These lesions are difficult to treat without 
surgery.
Postoperative
The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the 
pediatric population is as high as 33–82% depending on risk factors. 
Symptoms are most prominent in the first 24 hours postoperatively but 
can occur up to 7 days after surgery. Risk factors include age older than

SECTION 4  Gastrointestinal Disorders
3 years; duration of surgery >30 minutes; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) 
and ocular surgeries (e.g., tonsillectomy, strabismus surgery); inhaled 
anesthetic agents; higher postoperative pain; use of opioids; prolonged 
preoperative fasting; dehydrated state; and a family history of PONV. 
The higher the number of risk factors, the greater the chance of PONV. 
If the susceptible child is identified from these risk factors, prophylac­
tic therapy is generally effective. Combination therapy with dexameth­
asone and 5HT-­3 antagonists have been found most effective.
Porphyria
Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder of 
episodic abdominal pain (85–95% of patients); 40–90% of patients 
have associated vomiting. The association of neurologic symptoms 
such as mental status symptoms (50%), muscle weakness (50%), sen­
sory loss (20%), and convulsions (15%); onset after puberty; and the 
frequent association with menses or provocative drugs (sulfonamides, 
phenobarbital) are suggestive. Elevated levels of porphobilinogen and 
δ-­aminolevulinic acid in urine are suggestive, and decreased red blood 
cell porphobilinogen deaminase is diagnostic.
Familial Mediterranean Fever (Benign Paroxysmal Peritonitis, 
Periodic Peritonitis, Polyserositis)
Episodic attacks of abdominal pain with rapid development and 
resolution (within 48 hours) of peritoneal signs (fever, vomiting, 
absent bowel sounds) occurring in a child of Israeli or North African 
descent should suggest this autosomal recessive diagnosis. Synovitis, 
pleuritis, and an erysipelas-­like skin lesion are also characteristic. 
The ESR is raised. Fifty percent of patients have their first attack 
between 1 and 10 years of age; 90%, by age 20. Definitive genetic 
testing is available for detection of the familial Mediterranean fever 
gene.
Dysautonomia
Familial dysautonomia is an autosomal recessive disorder of the 
sensory and autonomic nervous systems affecting children of Ash­
kenazi Jewish descent. The gene for familial dysautonomia has been 
identified, allowing for both prenatal diagnosis and identification 
of carriers. Associated symptoms include disturbed swallowing, 
drooling, frequent pneumonias, absence of overflow tearing, erratic 
temperature control, skin blotching, postural hypotension, relative 
indifference to pain, corneal anesthesia, breath-­holding spells, motor 
incoordination, spinal curvature, and growth retardation. Glossal 
fungiform papillae are also absent. The disease is diagnosed with 
the intradermal histamine test or the conjunctival methacholine (or 
pilocarpine) test. Management is complex and requires a multidisci­
plinary team.
Complications of Vomiting
The complications of vomiting are outlined in Table 15.16. Their 
importance is twofold. First, these complications must be promptly 
treated, and second, there may be diagnostic implications.
Metabolic Complications
Dehydration results from decreased fluid intake because of anorexia 
or nausea, as well as from the loss of secretions in the emesis. The elec­
trolyte disturbance can vary depending upon the varying losses of gas­
tric hydrogen chloride (HCl), pancreatic bicarbonate (HCO3), and GI 
sodium chloride (NaCl). In high-­grade gastric outlet obstruction, pro­
longed vomiting causes loss of gastric HCl and produces an increase 
in plasma bicarbonate to compensate for loss of chloride. Potassium 
and sodium are also lost in the vomitus and are subsequently wasted 
by the kidneys when they accompany the renal excretion of bicar­
bonate caused by the alkalosis. This leads to the classically described 
hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. In states of marked 
alkalosis, urine pH is 7 or 8, and urinary sodium and potassium levels 
are high, despite serum sodium and potassium depletion. Urine chlo­
ride, however, remains low, reflecting the nonrenal losses of chloride. 
Intravenous fluid therapy is often required, and must be designed with 
an understanding of the sodium and potassium deficits. Preoperative 
restoration of electrolyte imbalance reduces perioperative morbidity in 
cases of gastric outlet obstruction.

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
Nutritional Complications
The nutritional deficits resulting from chronic vomiting and asso­
ciated anorexia are obvious. No more than a day or two of fluid 
therapy should take place without attention to nutritional needs. 
Frequent, small, high-­carbohydrate feedings may minimize the 
stimulation to vomit, but continuous nasogastric or nasojejunal 
feedings are sometimes needed for cases of chronic vomiting. The 
presence of metabolic or allergic disease should be considered 
when the reintroduction of protein leads to relapse of symptoms. In 
severely malnourished individuals, rapid reinstitution of nutrition 
can lead to refeeding syndrome, which is characterized by meta­
bolic disturbances such as low phosphate, potassium, and magne­
sium, which, if severe enough, can be fatal. During refeeding the 
insulin secretion is triggered in response to increased blood sugar, 
thus increasing the synthesis of glycogen, protein, and fat. This pro­
cess requires phosphate, potassium, and magnesium, the stores of 
which are already low and get quickly depleted, leading to cardiac, 
pulmonary, and neurologic complications. Gradual introduction of 
calories and close monitoring of blood chemistry are therefore nec­
essary during the early refeeding period.
Mallory-­Weiss Tear
This linear mucosal laceration in the juxtaesophageal gastric mucosa 
usually occurs after prolonged forceful retching or vomiting. Invisible 
radiographically, it is diagnosed endoscopically (if necessary). Mallory-­
Weiss tears usually necessitate no treatment and supportive care.
Peptic Esophagitis
Esophagitis, similar to that resulting from gastroesophageal reflux, 
may result from chronic vomiting from many causes. Diagnosed 
endoscopically or histologically, it should be treated. The treatment of 
esophagitis usually includes H2-­receptor antagonists or PPIs; proki­
netic agents may also be needed.
Therapy
Therapy of vomiting starts with treatment of the cause, treatment of 
complications, and treatment of behavioral aspects that may perpet­
uate the vomiting. General supportive and more specific pharmaco­
logic approaches to therapy are outlined in Tables 15.17 and 15.18. The 
physician should be very careful about treating the vomiting symptom 
without diagnosing and treating its cause. In several situations, diag­
nostic procedures, such as Gastrografin enema for fecal obstructions 
in cystic fibrosis, barium enema for intussusception, and endoscopy 
with sclerotherapy for variceal hematemesis, are also therapeutic. As 
noted, many causes of vomiting involve psychologic and higher corti­
cal influences. In these cases, psychobehavioral and multidisciplinary 
approaches are often essential to successful management. Such thera­
pies are focused on returning the disabled child to proper functioning 
and school attendance while eliminating secondary gain for vom­
iting and reducing surrounding anxiety. Cognitive-­behavioral and 
psychologic therapies may be helpful in isolation or with concurrent 
pharmacotherapy.
Antiemetic Drugs
In situations of persistent vomiting, antiemetic drugs are useful to 
reduce the metabolic and nutritional consequences and interrupt 
vicious circles in which psychogenic factors may also participate. Since 
multiple neurotransmitters and chemoreceptors are involved in emetic

pathways, most antiemetics can be broadly classified based on their 
mechanism of action as follows:
Serotonin receptor antagonists: Ondansetron and granisetron are 
the most used drugs in this category and are available as both intra­
venous and oral preparations. They act by blocking serotonin 5HT-­3 
receptors at both peripheral and central levels. Side effects include pos­
sible QTc prolongation.
Dopamine receptor antagonists: Dopamine receptor antagonists 
antagonize the D2-­receptor in the area postrema. Metoclopramide, 
prochlorperazine, and promethazine are common drugs in this class. 
Metoclopramide promotes foregut motility by other mechanisms, 
while the latter two have additional anticholinergic and antihista­
mine effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms (tardive dyskinesia, dysto­
nia) are possible serious side effects. Domperidone is a peripheral 
D2-­receptor antagonist and has antiemetic and promotility effects as 
well.
Anticholinergics: Scopolamine is an anticholinergic that antago­
nizes the muscarinic receptor and is predominantly used to prevent

CHAPTER 15  Vomiting and Regurgitation
motion sickness. Common side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, 
and vision changes.
Antihistamines: Antihistamines act on the H1-­ and H2-­receptors 
and the most common reported side effect is drowsiness. Examples are 
promethazine and diphenhydramine.
NK-­1 antagonists: NK-­1 antagonists are inhibitors for the NK-­1 
receptor, which prevents binding of substance P (a known emetogen). 
Aprepitant (orally) and fosaprepitant (intravenously) are the com­
monly used drugs in this category. NK-­1 antagonists were initially 
developed for treatment of chemotherapy-­induced emesis but have 
also proven beneficial in other etiologies such as CVS. Side effects are 
uncommon but may include headache, dizziness, and hypersensitiv­
ity reactions.
Anxiolytics: Benzodiazepines are commonly used and particularly 
helpful in anxiety-­induced emesis and when sedative effects are needed 
as for acute/abortive therapy of CVS episodes.
Cannabinoids: Cannabinoids are controversial antiemetics given 
the possibility of psychedelic and addictive effects with long-­term use. 
At this time, use is limited to chemotherapy-­induced nausea, vomiting, 
and anorexia.
Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids have limited use in chemothera­
py-­ and irradiation-­induced nausea and vomiting and cases of adrenal 
crisis. The mechanism of action as an antiemetic is not clear.
Promotility agents: Erythromycin acts on the motilin receptors 
located in the gastric smooth muscle, enhancing gastric motility. Cis­
apride, a 5HT-­4-­receptor agonist, also facilitates gastric motility, but 
due to its arrhythmogenic potential it is only available in the United 
States via restricted, compassionate care protocols.
In some settings, the diverse sites of action account for the useful 
additive effects of these drugs. Optimal therapy for vomiting caused 
by chemotherapy, for example, may include several agents to provide 
blockade of the multiple receptor types. Serotonin and dopamine recep­
tor antagonists are the most widely used general antiemetic agents.
Although treatment for many functional GI and motility causes of 
emesis is often empiric, disease-­specific therapies and guidelines are 
available for certain syndromes. For example, treatment for CVS can be 
divided into lifestyle modification, abortive or rescue therapy to prevent 
progression from the prodromal to emetic phase, supportive therapy 
during episodes, and prophylactic daily therapy to prevent future epi­
sodes (see Table 15.13). Lifestyle changes include adequate fluid intake, 
frequent calorie intake, and regimented sleep along with stress reduction.
Supportive therapy includes dextrose 10% containing intrave­
nous fluids to diminish catabolism, less stimulating environment, 
and a combination of antiemetics and sedatives/anxiolytics to atten­
uate symptoms. Many of these agents can also help abort an early 
episode.

Vomiting and regurgitation are commonly encountered in pediatrics 
and can signify underlying problems with a wide array of body systems. 
Although acute vomiting most commonly results from self-­resolving 
infectious illnesses, the medical provider needs to carefully evaluate for 
red flags that may herald serious emergencies and surgical conditions. 
When emesis becomes chronic, the specific temporal pattern and asso­
ciated signs and symptoms should direct further diagnostic work-­up. 
Although therapy is often empiric, treatment trials should be tailored 
to the underlying cause and the individual patient. Red flags are noted 
in Table 15.6.
