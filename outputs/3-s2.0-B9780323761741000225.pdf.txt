Proteinuria can be detected by various means, and the most common 
is the dipstick test, a calorimetric assay that spots only albumin and 
not low-­molecular-­weight proteins. In addition, false-­positive dipstick 
assessment can be seen with highly concentrated urine, alkaline urine, 
the presence of contrast media, vaginal secretions, or semen. False neg­
atives are less common but can be seen with very dilute urine. Though 
24-­hour urine collection is the gold standard to quantify the protein­
uria, spot urine protein-­to-­creatinine ratio can be used for initial con­
firmation after a positive screen with dipstick or to trend proteinuria 
(Table 22.1). A ratio <0.2 protein mg/creatinine mg is considered nor­
mal in children older than 2 years of age and a ratio <0.5 mg/mg is 
considered normal in younger children between 6 months and 2 years 
of age. In timed collection, protein excretion >240 mg/m2 in 24 hours 
in children younger than 6 months of age and >150 mg/m2 in older 
children is considered abnormal, and over 40 mg/m2/hr (>3 g/1.73 m2/
day) is considered nephrotic range. Qualitative analysis of protein in 
urine by immunonephelometry or electrophoresis helps distinguish 
glomerular from tubular proteinuria.
Proteinuria in children can be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. 
Transient and orthostatic proteinuria are benign conditions and require 
no treatment. Several factors including fever, stress, hypovolemia, exer­
cise, and seizures can lead to transient proteinuria (Table 22.2). Ortho­
static proteinuria is defined as increased protein in urine only when 
upright. In this condition, absence of proteinuria when horizontal and 
resting can be confirmed by documenting absence of protein in a first 
morning void. Split day/night urine collection is the gold standard to 
diagnose orthostatic proteinuria, which is a common benign cause of 
proteinuria, especially in adolescents. Persistent proteinuria requires 
meticulous evaluation to rule out renal pathology.
Evaluation of proteinuria begins with a detailed history and physical 
examination. Pertinent histories that help distinguish pathologic from 
benign proteinuria include history of respiratory symptoms concur­
rent with or preceding the proteinuria, presence of red urine, edema, 
positive family history of kidney disease, or hearing loss. Findings of 
edema and hypertension suggest pathologic proteinuria. Repeating 
urine dipstick in asymptomatic children with a negative history can 
eliminate unnecessary further testing for transient proteinuria. If still 
positive, spot urine protein-­to-­creatinine ratio can help confirm the 
presence of proteinuria. If confirmed, a first morning void protein-­
to-­creatinine ratio can then identify orthostatic proteinuria. Once the 
benign conditions are ruled out in asymptomatic children, further 
testing is similar to that of symptomatic children and these children 
should be referred to nephrologists. This more detailed evaluation 
begins with 24-­hour urine collection where possible, complete urinal­
ysis, and sediment evaluation looking for glomerular or other paren­
chymal pathology that could be causing the proteinuria (Fig. 22.1). 
Positive leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and presence of pyuria or bacteri­
uria suggest a urinary tract infection. If not resolved with treatment 
of infection, proteinuria will need further evaluation. Low molecular 
proteins, such as β2-­microglobulin, α1-­microglobulin, lysozyme, and 
retinol-­binding protein, are found in tubular proteinuria as is seen 
in Fanconi syndrome or Dent disease. Red blood cell (RBC) casts are 
pathognomonic of glomerulonephritis. Serum chemistry including 
creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, albumin, and cholesterol will also help 
separate proteinuria secondary to glomerulonephritis or nephrotic 
syndrome. Lupus antibody studies, streptococcal infection, and com­
plement C3 and C4 levels along with viral studies can help delineate the 
various causes of glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome. Renal 
ultrasound should be considered to rule out any gross parenchymal 
etiology for the proteinuria, such as dysplastic kidney and cystic kidney 
disease. Renal biopsy may be indicated if there is evidence for worsen­
ing of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, deteriorating renal function, or 
a poor response to the initial therapy.
Differential diagnoses for proteinuria are extensive, as described 
in Table 22.2. The initial evaluation of a patient with proteinuria is pre­
sented in Table 22.3. Indications for a referral to a pediatric nephrologist 
are described in Table 22.4. If there is obvious edema with proteinuria, 
the diagnostic evaluation noted in Table 22.3 advances directly to the 
second phase and, if necessary, to the third phase.
The combination of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and 
hyperlipidemia are the defining features of nephrotic syndrome. 
Nephrotic syndrome may be a result of many primary etiologic factors, 
with varying renal pathologic processes and long-­term consequences. 
Proteinuria that causes edema is always clinically significant, although 
not all edema is secondary to proteinuria (Table 22.5). All children 
with nephrotic syndrome invariably have “nephrotic range” protein­
uria, necessitating detailed evaluation, and most require treatment. In 
rare cases, a child with asymptomatic proteinuria has nephrotic-­range 
proteinuria. If there is concomitant hypoalbuminemia and hyperlip­
idemia, the work-­up proceeds as if the child presented with nephrotic 
syndrome, despite the absence of edema. Even without hypoalbumin­
emia and hyperlipidemia, nephrotic-­range proteinuria is less likely to 
be benign than is less marked asymptomatic proteinuria.
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME IN YOUNG CHILDREN
Differential Diagnosis
Three diseases constitute all cases of isolated nephrotic syndrome: 
minimal change disease (the most common), focal segmental sclerosis 
(also called focal glomerular sclerosis), and membranous glomerulop­
athy. These classifications are based on pathologic findings. Thus, these 
presentations could be primary or secondary due to other causes. In 
addition, nephrotic syndrome can be present along with glomerulone­
phritis (GN), such as postinfectious GN, immunoglobulin A (IgA) GN, 
or membranoproliferative GN. Systemic diseases also cause childhood 
nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 10% of cases. The three foremost

SECTION 5  Genitourinary Disorders
considerations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IgA vas­
culitis (Henoch-­Schönlein purpura), and hemolytic uremic syndrome. 
These diseases have extrarenal manifestations in addition to the pro­
teinuria and must be considered in any child who presents with sys­
temic illness and significant proteinuria. Hereditary forms of nephrotic 
syndrome are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders repre­
senting a spectrum of hereditary renal diseases (Table 22.6 and Fig. 
22.2). Over 45 recessive or dominant genes have been associated with 
steroid-­resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS)/hereditary nephrotic 
syndrome in humans (Table 22.7). Several of the more common disor­
ders along with other causes of nephrotic syndrome are noted in Tables 
22.8 and 22.9. Causes of congenital nephrotic syndrome (in infants 3 
months of age or younger) are noted in Table 22.10.
MINIMAL CHANGE DISEASE
Most cases of nephrotic syndrome in children are caused by min­
imal change nephrotic syndrome, defined as normal histologic 
features of the kidney by light microscopy and immune stains. 
Preschool-­aged children constitute the age group in which minimal 
change nephrotic syndrome is most common. Patients often present 
with asymptomatic edema, which may manifest as swollen or puffy 
eyes upon awakening in the morning; increasing abdominal girth 
(increased waist or belt size) from ascites; pedal or leg edema, which 
causes difficulty in putting on their regular-­sized shoes, especially 
after being upright during the daytime; or swelling in other sites, 
such as the scrotum, penis, vulva, and scalp. Tense edema or ascites 
is occasionally painful.
Minimal change nephrotic syndrome is slightly more common in 
males than in females. The hallmark of this disease is total clearing of 
the proteinuria with oral prednisone therapy. A common misconcep­
tion is that neither hematuria nor hypertension is present in children 
with minimal change disease. Microscopic hematuria and hyperten­
sion are present in up to 20% of children who have minimal change 
disease. The BUN or serum creatinine level may also be elevated in up 
to 30% of the cases, usually from prerenal causes. Serum complement 
studies are normal. Older age, hematuria, hypertension, and azotemia 
may occur with minimal change nephrotic syndrome, but the combi­
nation suggests another disease.
Diagnosis
Studies that would help confirm that a patient with nephrotic syn­
drome has minimal change disease include urinalysis; serum chem­
istry including BUN, creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol levels; and 
complements and lupus antibody titers.
The urinalysis would be expected to show 3+ to 4+ protein, which 
is correlated with a urine concentration of 300–2,000 mg/dL. The urine 
may also occasionally yield positive results for blood. Microscopic 
examination of the urine sediment often shows oval fat bodies and/
or refractile granular casts, which are seen when there is significant 
lipiduria. Red blood cells might also be present, but it is unusual to 
see red blood cell casts. Their presence would suggest a diagnosis of 
glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 23).
The complement C3 and C4 levels are normal in minimal change dis­
ease and are depressed in some other causes of nephritis (see Chapter 23). 
The serum cholesterol values are elevated in minimal change nephrotic 
syndrome and are usually >250 mg/dL; levels in the range of 500–600 mg/
dL may occur. The serum albumin concentration is invariably <2.5 and 
often <2.0 g/dL. A renal biopsy is not immediately indicated because most 
patients (>90%) with minimal change disease respond to prednisone, a 
response that is considered diagnostic.
Treatment
With a presumptive diagnosis of minimal change nephrotic syn­
drome, it is recommended that patients be placed on a therapeutic 
course of prednisone, 60 mg/m2/day or 2 mg/kg/day, up to a maxi­
mum of 60 mg for 4–6 weeks, followed by a dose of 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 
mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) given every other day for another 6 weeks. 
In most patients, there is total resolution of proteinuria within 10–21 
days of initiating therapy. Patients who do not respond to prednisone 
therapy should be considered candidates for a renal biopsy to guide 
further therapy.

CHAPTER 22  Proteinuria
Total clearing of proteinuria in response to prednisone is an 
excellent prognostic sign. Very few patients progress to renal failure, 
although many patients (∼80%) who initially respond to prednisone 
therapy with total clearing of proteinuria may have relapses and require 
intermittent prednisone therapy for many years. Approximately 18% 
of patients treated with prednisone for minimal change nephrotic syn­
drome respond to therapy and never experience a relapse.
Patients with recurrent nephrotic syndrome are subgrouped into 
those who experience frequent and infrequent relapses. A patient 
with infrequent relapse has fewer than two relapses in any 6-­month 
period; a person with frequent relapse has two or more relapses within 
6 months. Prednisone should be reinitiated at a dose of 60 mg/m2/day 
or 2 mg/kg/day until a maximum of 60 mg/day and continued until the 
urine test results are negative for protein for 3 consecutive days. After 
that, alternate-­day prednisone is given at a dose of 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/
kg (maximum 40 mg) in the morning for another 4 weeks and then dis­
continued altogether. Relapses are frequent during the influenza virus 
seasons; any minor upper respiratory infection may trigger a relapse 
of nephrotic syndrome. Patients who suffer infrequent relapses may be 
treated with prednisone alone.
Patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome may be ste­
roid dependent and require constant daily prednisone therapy to main­
tain a remission. Because constant daily prednisone has significant 
untoward side effects (growth failure, cushingoid facies, osteoporosis, 
cataracts, opportunistic infections, hypertension, and glucose intoler­
ance), other therapies need to be considered. A renal biopsy is recom­
mended prior to initiating alternative agents to confirm the diagnosis 
of minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Treatment strategies with 
corticosteroid-­sparing agents for patients with frequent relapse who 
develop steroid-­related adverse effects include alkylating agents, cyclo­
phosphamide or chlorambucil, and more recently rituximab.
Complications of Nephrotic Syndrome
Even in patients with the frequent relapse variant of minimal change 
disease, the incidence of renal failure is only 1%. The reported mortal­
ity rate remains higher, at approximately 5%.
Infection
The major cause of death in nephrotic syndrome is overwhelming 
infection, usually secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 
which develops in as many as 10% of patients with nephrotic syndrome 
at some point in the course of illness. Such infection is most frequent 
in patients who are edematous with significant ascites. Peritoneal fluid 
interferes with macrophage function, whereas ascitic fluid may dilute 
local complement or immunoglobulin levels, altering host defense 
mechanisms in the peritoneum.
The most common pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Escherichia 
coli and Staphylococcus aureus are other etiologic agents that may cause 
spontaneous peritonitis in patients with minimal change disease. With 
the use of appropriate antibiotics, mortality from peritonitis is ∼10%. Any 
child with nephrotic syndrome in relapse with evidence of ascites needs to 
be evaluated quickly if either abdominal pain or fever develops. A blood 
specimen and paracentesis (e.g., Gram stain, culture, neutrophil count, 
measurement of glucose and protein levels) should be obtained, and the 
patient should be started on intravenous cefotaxime and an aminoglyco­
side or ceftriaxone alone without further delay. The neutrophil count in 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is usually ≥250 cells/mm3.
Thrombosis
A second serious complication of nephrotic syndrome is spontaneous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or both. The blood of patients with 
nephrotic syndrome is hypercoagulable, and there is an increased inci­
dence of thrombotic phenomena in these children. Children can have 
arterial thrombosis, as well as venous thrombosis with resultant pul­
monary emboli. The renal vein and dural sinus veins are other possible 
sites of thrombosis. Use of injectable and oral antithrombolytic agents, 
in addition to heparin, have allowed for more effective treatment of 
thrombotic complications.
Hyperlipidemia
Hyperlipidemia is treated by some authorities with statins to lower the 
serum cholesterol levels and theoretically reduce vascular pathologic 
processes.

SECTION 5  Genitourinary Disorders
OTHER FORMS OF NEPHROTIC SYNDROME
Focal Segmental Sclerosis
Diagnosis
Clinical criteria do not always allow clinicians to differentiate mini­
mal change disease from focal segmental sclerosis before completion 
of a course of prednisone therapy. Inability to clear proteinuria com­
pletely during prednisone therapy may be the first indication of focal 
segmental sclerosis. Patients who respond to prednisone initially 
with clearing of proteinuria but do not respond to a course of ste­
roids in a subsequent relapse should also be considered to have focal 
segmental sclerosis. Such patients represent about 7% of those who 
have an initial response to prednisone therapy. A patient who does 
not respond to prednisone with total clearing of proteinuria should 
undergo renal biopsy.
Focal segmental sclerosis may be primary (idiopathic) or sec­
ondary to severe obesity, reflux nephropathy, sickle cell nephropa­
thy, reduced renal mass (single kidney), opiate or analgesic abuse, 
chronic bacteremia (endocarditis), renal transplant rejection, or 
nephropathy resulting from HIV infection. Genetic variants in 
several genes result in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The 
genetic basis of these hereditary focal segmental glomerulosclerotic 
disorders is genetically heterogeneous. Nine hereditary subtypes 
have been described. FSGS1:ACTN4; FSGS2:TRPC6; FSGS3:C­
D2AP; FSGS4:APOL1; FSGS5:INF2; FSGS6:MYO1E; FSGS7:PAX2;

CHAPTER 22  Proteinuria
proteins that are involved in the structure and function of the podo­
cyte foot process (see Table 22.7).
Treatment
Results of treatment of focal segmental sclerosis have been poor. 
Patients have severe and unremitting proteinuria despite treatment 
with prednisone, chlorambucil, or cyclophosphamide. The long-­term 
outcome has been poor; 33% are in renal failure ∼10 years after diag­
nosis, and nearly 100% are in renal failure 20 years after diagnosis. The 
incidence of focal segmental sclerosis appears to be increasing, possibly 
related to obesity and genetic predisposition.
Patients with focal segmental sclerosis present two difficult prob­
lems. First, renal function may be maintained reasonably well for 
years, but massive proteinuria persists. Hence, patients are often 
edematous for months or years, and stigmata of protein malnutrition 
may develop as a result of large protein losses. Symptomatic ther­
apy with a low-­sodium diet and judicious use of diuretics is some­
times effective. Dietary manipulation of protein intake is ineffective; 
increasing dietary protein intake is accompanied by a concomitant 
increase in urinary protein excretion. There is no evidence that pro­
tein restriction either modifies serum proteins or prevents progres­
sion to renal insufficiency.
The second problem occurs when affected patients progress to end-­
stage renal failure. Recurrence of the disease in transplanted kidneys 
occurs in 25–30% of recipients. Therefore, many patients undergo a 
long period of dialysis before receiving a kidney transplant in an effort 
to diminish the frequency of recurrent disease.
Some patients respond to calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine, or 
tacrolimus, with total clearing of their proteinuria. There may be no 
progression to renal insufficiency. It is unknown what percentage of 
patients with focal segmental sclerosis respond to cyclosporine; it is 
estimated that 25–60% have an initial response.
Membranous Nephropathy
Membranous nephropathy is a pathologic diagnosis made follow­
ing renal biopsy and may be primary or secondary to other diseases 
(e.g., hepatitis, SLE, or malignancy) or toxins and drugs such as non­
steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, gold, mercury, bismuth, silver, 
d-­penicillamine, trimethadione, probenecid, and captopril. All the 
secondary causes must be considered and should be addressed and 
treated before the condition is considered primary. Antibodies against 
the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) in the serum or a renal biopsy 
by immune staining have been identified in 70% of patients with pri­
mary or idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Circulating antibodies 
against thrombospondin type-­1 domain-­containing 7A (THSD7A) are 
found in another 5–10% of the remaining patients with primary mem­
branous nephropathy. The changes in the antibody titers correspond 
to remission or relapse of proteinuria and can be used to monitor the 
disease.
Treatment
Addressing the triggers of secondary membranous nephropathy in 
itself may result in resolution of proteinuria in the majority of cases. 
Membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE is more difficult to treat. 
In addition, the increased incidence of spontaneous resolution of the 
proteinuria makes selecting the patients who should be treated very 
complicated. Close monitoring of primary membranous nephropathy 
to determine the need for treatment is recommended for 6 months prior 
to initiating treatment. Sodium restriction, diuretics, and angiotensin-­
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can be used for control of protein­
uria and symptoms. In patients with no decrease of proteinuria, or with

SECTION 5  Genitourinary Disorders
severe, life-­threatening symptoms related to the nephrotic syndrome, 
immunosuppression with steroids and cyclophosphamide can be tried.
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME IN INFANTS 
YOUNGER THAN 1 YEAR
Nephrotic syndrome that manifests very early in life is a much more 
serious entity, and the prognosis is guarded (see Table 22.9). The out­
look is poorest in younger infants (younger than 6 months of age) and 
improves as the age at presentation approaches 1 year. Minimal change 
disease is rarely seen in infants younger than 6 months of age. It is more 
common in infants who present at 6–8 months. By 1 year, it is the most 
common cause of nephrotic syndrome.
The conditions that result in nephrotic syndrome in infants differ 
markedly from those seen in older children. Secondary causes are more 
prominent and need to be considered, particularly in newborns or very 
young infants. It is especially important to test for syphilis because the 
early institution of penicillin therapy may lead to the resolution of the 
renal disease and may mitigate the involvement of other organ systems 
as well. Congenital toxoplasmosis is also treatable with the combina­
tion of steroids and pyrimethamine–sulfadiazine–folinic acid. Other 
congenital infections offer less opportunity for treatment to influence 
the outcome; extrarenal manifestations of these infections are much 
more serious than kidney disease.
Primary renal disease–causing nephrotic syndrome in early infancy 
is most often caused by either congenital nephrotic syndrome or dif­
fuse mesangial sclerosis. In both diseases, the prognosis for survival is 
poor unless aggressive supportive therapy and kidney transplantation 
are undertaken.
Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an autosomal recessive disor­
der resulting from variants in the gene encoding the protein, neph­
rin, and other genes (see Table 22.10 and Fig. 22.2). Infants with

Fig. 22.2  Relative distribution of steroid-­resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS)-­causing genes by their age of 
onset. Percentages of families in an international cohort with SRNS that manifested at 25 years of age and 
resulted from variants in monogenic genes are interconnected by lines between age groups and shown in 
different colors for each causative gene (lower panel for recessive genes, upper panel for dominant genes). 
NPHS1 variants (red), LAMB2 (orange), and PLCE1 (dark blue) have early age of onset and are rarely found 
in patients older than 6 years. The dominant genes INF2 (light blue) and TRPC6 (brown) manifest in early 
adulthood, and WT1 (black) shows a biphasic distribution with a first peak at 4–12 months and a second 
peak for age of onset beyond 18 years (upper panel). These findings are compatible with the notion that 
variants in recessive disease genes are found more frequently in early-­onset disease, whereas variants in 
dominant genes more frequently cause adult-­onset disease. (Modified from Sadowski CE, Lovric S, Ashraf 
S, et al. A single-­gene cause in 29.5% of cases of steroid-­resistant nephrotic syndrome. J Am Soc Nephrol.

congenital nephrotic syndrome are often premature, with a low birth­
weight, placentomegaly, increased amniotic fluid α-­fetoprotein levels, 
and hypogammaglobinemia (decreased immunoglobulin G levels).
Ascites and edema, caused by massive proteinuria, are usually pres­
ent in affected infants during the first few weeks after birth. Patients 
do not respond to steroids or cytotoxic therapy. Infections and throm­
bosis are the two major complications; they cause considerable mor­
bidity and mortality. Because of the massive proteinuria, patients 
fail to thrive; they require nasogastric feeding with a high-­calorie, 
high-­protein formula. Nephrectomy and peritoneal dialysis are often 
necessary to control protein losses and allow for adequate growth and 
control of uremia so that the infant can reach a size and nutritional 
state sufficient for renal transplantation.
Diffuse Mesangial Sclerosis
Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is the other diagnostic entity seen in infants. 
This disease is similar to congenital nephrotic syndrome, but it often 
results in less severe protein losses. Patients are often full term and of a 
normal birthweight. The amniotic fluid α-­fetoprotein is normal, and the 
onset of edema (1 week–33 months) is later than in congenital nephrotic

syndrome (birth–3 months). The patients have hypertension, hematuria, 
and renal insufficiency at presentation. When diffuse mesangial sclerosis 
is seen in association with a female phenotype, chromosome typing is rec­
ommended to look for patients with Drash syndrome (XY gonadal dys­
genesis, nephropathy, and Wilms tumor). When this syndrome is present, 
bilateral nephrectomy and gonadectomy are recommended because the 
potential for malignancy is very high.
Treatment is similar to patients with congenital nephrotic syn­
drome and eventually requires renal transplantation. The major goal is 
to help these infants achieve the growth and good nutrition necessary 
for successful renal transplantation. Nephrotic syndrome occasionally 
occurs after transplantation for congenital nephrotic syndrome, proba­
bly secondarily to an autoimmune reaction to nephrin.
ASYMPTOMATIC PROTEINURIA DISORDERS
Many patients have proteinuria, but there is no edema, the blood pres­
sure is normal, and serum protein levels are normal. The extent of the 
work-­up must be tailored to the seriousness of the problem. Whether 
an evaluation should be performed depends on whether the protein­
uria is both persistent and nonorthostatic (Fig. 22.3). A child younger 
than 7 or 8 years of age who has persistent isolated proteinuria, normal 
blood pressure, renal function, and total protein and serum albumin 
levels should be observed carefully with repeated urinalyses every 3–6 
months and parents counseled with regard to swelling and/or ascites, 
which may develop in association with influenza or an upper respira­
tory infection. If there is evidence of overt nephrotic syndrome with

CHAPTER 22  Proteinuria
edema, a decrease in serum albumin, and an increase in serum choles­
terol, a trial of daily prednisone therapy is indicated. It is good practice 
to give the pneumococcal vaccine to patients who have persistent pro­
teinuria but no evidence of edema or nephrotic syndrome, because of 
the risk of pneumococcal peritonitis if nephrotic syndrome develops. If 
the patient has a more serious lesion, symptoms will develop, at which 
time evaluation and therapy may be undertaken.
In a patient older than 8 or 9 years, once the presence of persistent 
and nonorthostatic proteinuria is established, the next step is to quan­
tify the amount of protein in a 24-­hour specimen. If urinary protein 
excretion is >1 g/day, a renal biopsy may be considered. Alternatively, 
these patients can also be treated with steroids and the response 
assessed. If proteinuria does not clear after 6–8 weeks of therapy, 
renal biopsy is then indicated. The choice of 1 g/day of proteinuria 
is arbitrary; nephrotic syndrome is defined as 40 mg/m2/hr. Hence, 
an average 8-­year-­old patient who weighs 30 kg and has surface area 
1 m2 nephrotic syndrome by this definition is at a level of 960 mg/
day. Renal biopsy should be considered at lower range if there are 
additional features suggestive of glomerulonephritis. This guideline 
helps avoid a biopsy for the patient with minimal proteinuria because 
isolated proteinuria is an unlikely possibility with membranoprolif­
erative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) or SLE. However, the incidence 
of focal segmental sclerosis is much higher in adolescents than in 
younger children. With the possibility of treatment with cyclospo­
rine and/or ACE inhibitors preventing future renal failure, aggressive 
evaluation is warranted to identify patients who might benefit from 
these therapies.
Low molecular protein, such as β2-microglobulin, α1-­microglobulin, 
lysozyme, and retinol-­binding protein, can be seen in urine in tubular 
disorders, such as Fanconi syndrome or Dent disease. If associated with 
acidosis, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia, Fanconi syndrome 
should be considered. In males, if proteinuria is associated with hyper­
calciuria and nephrocalcinosis, Dent disease, an X-­linked proximal 
tubulopathy that eventually leads to end-­stage renal disease, should be 
considered, and the urine should be tested for β2-microglobulin. Genetic 
testing can confirm the diagnosis.
The presence of protein in the urine increases the risk of renal insuf­
ficiency, regardless of its cause. This has led to therapies that reduce 
proteinuria, thereby decreasing the risk of a progressive loss of renal 
function. The traffic of protein across the glomerular capillary mem­
brane appears to stimulate a cascade of inflammatory events that cause 
interstitial fibrosis. ACE inhibitors result in efferent arteriolar vasodi­
latation, leading to a decrease in intraglomerular pressure, which in 
turn leads to a decreased transport of protein across the glomerular 
filter. Patients who are treated with ACE inhibitors are less likely to 
increase their level of proteinuria and are less likely to lose their renal 
function than are patients who are not treated with these agents. This 
was first apparent in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, but there 
is evidence that ACE inhibitors offer advantages to patients with other 
nephropathies as well. Angiotensin II blockers offer another avenue for 
accomplishing a decrease in intraglomerular pressures, and these also 
decrease proteinuria when used alone or in conjunction with an ACE 
inhibitor. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers may be useful for 
patients with proteinuria either as a first step or as adjunctive therapy 
for those who fail to respond to other medications.

Asymptomatic proteinuria may be associated with nonspecific febrile 
benign illnesses, postural mechanisms, and glomerular or tubular dys­
function. Significant proteinuria with edema suggests nephrotic syn­
drome, which in most children suggests minimal change nephrotic 
syndrome. An age younger than 1 year or older than 10 years plus sig­
nificant hematuria, azotemia, and hypertension are red flags that sug­
gest a cause of nephrosis other than the more benign minimal change 
disease. Additional red flags include a poor response to prednisone 
therapy and signs of multiple organ system involvement by a primary 
systemic disease, such as SLE. Fever and abdominal pain in a patient 
with nephrotic syndrome should suggest spontaneous primary bacte­
rial peritonitis. Severe headache and respiratory distress in a patient 
with nephrotic syndrome should raise concerns for thrombosis or pul­
monary embolus.
