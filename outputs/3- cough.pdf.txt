INTRODUCTION
Cough is an important defense mechanism of the lungs and is a com­
mon symptom, particularly during winter months. In most patients, 
it is self-­limited. However, cough can be ominous, indicating serious 
underlying disease, because of accompanying problems (hemoptysis) 
or because of serious consequences of the cough itself (e.g., syncope 
and hemorrhage), or cough may present as an uncommon disorder 
that mimics a common disease.
Pathophysiology
The cough reflex serves to prevent the entry of harmful substances into 
the tracheobronchial tree and to expel excess secretions and retained 
material from the tracheobronchial tree. Cough begins with stimula­
tion of cough receptors, located in the upper and lower airways, and in 
many other sites such as the ear canal, tympanic membrane, sinuses, 
nose, pericardium, pleura, and diaphragm. Receptors send impulses 
via vagal, phrenic, glossopharyngeal, or trigeminal nerves to the “cough 
center,” which is in the medulla. Because cough is not only an invol­
untary reflex activity but also one that can be initiated or suppressed 
voluntarily, “higher centers” must also be involved in the afferent limb 
of the responsible pathway. The neural impulses go from the medulla to 
the appropriate efferent pathways to the larynx, tracheobronchial tree, 
and expiratory muscles.
The act of coughing (Fig. 3.1) begins with an inspiration, followed 
by expiration against a closed glottis (compressive phase), resulting in 
the buildup of intrathoracic pressures (50–300 cm H2O). These pres­
sures may be transmitted to vascular, cerebrospinal, and intraocular 
spaces. Finally, the glottis opens, allowing for explosive expiratory air­
flow (300 m/sec) and expulsion of mucus, particularly from the larger, 
central airways. The inability to seal the upper airway (e.g., endotra­
cheal tube or tracheostomy) impairs the effectiveness of cough. Respi­
ratory muscle weakness (e.g., muscular dystrophy) impairs both the 
inspiratory and the compressive phase.
History
The history often provides the most important body of information 
about a child’s cough. A diagnosis can often be discerned with relative 
certainty from the environmental and exposure history, family history, 
timeframe, and characterization of the cough.
Demographics
The patient’s age (Table 3.1) helps to focus the diagnostic possibilities. 
Congenital anatomic abnormalities may be symptomatic from birth, 
whereas toddlers, who may have incomplete neurologic control over 
swallowing and often put small objects in their mouths, are at risk for 
foreign body aspiration; adolescents may experiment with smoking 
traditional cigarettes, e-­cigarettes, or vaping. Socioeconomic factors 
must be considered; a family that cannot afford central heating may 
use a smoky wood-­burning stove; spending time at a daycare center 
may expose an infant to respiratory viruses; and several adult smokers 
in a small home expose children to a high concentration of respiratory 
irritants.
Characteristics of the Cough
The various cough characteristics can help determine the cause of 
cough. The causes of acute, recurrent, and chronic coughs may be quite 
different from each other (Fig. 3.2; see also Table 3.1). A cough can be 
paroxysmal, brassy, productive, weak, volitional, and “throat-­clearing,” 
and it may occur at different times of the day (Tables 3.2 and 3.3). The 
previous response or lack of response to some therapies for recurrent 
and chronic cough can provide important information (see Table 3.3). 
Furthermore, some coughs may be caused or worsened by medications 
(Table 3.4).
Associated Symptoms
A history of accompanying signs or symptoms, whether localized to 
the respiratory tract (e.g., wheeze, stridor, transient tachypnea of the 
newborn) or elsewhere (e.g., failure to thrive, frequent malodorous 
stools) can give important clues (Table 3.5; see also Tables 3.2 and 3.3). 
It is essential to remember that the daily language of the physician is 
full of jargon that may be adopted by parents but with a different mean­
ing from that understood by physicians. If a parent says that a child 
“wheezes” or “croups” or is “short of breath,” it is important to find out 
what the parent means by that term and ask them to mimic the sound 
or action.
Family and Patient’s Medical History
Because many disorders of childhood have genetic or environmen­
tal familial components, the family history can provide helpful 
information:
 • Are there older siblings with cystic fibrosis (CF) or asthma?
 • Is there a coughing sibling whose kindergarten class has been closed 
because of pertussis or COVID-­19?
 • Is there an adolescent or adult with chronic cough (bronchitis) who 
may have pertussis or tuberculosis?
 • Was the child premature, and if so, did they spend a month on the 
ventilator, and do they now have chronic lung disease (bronchopul­
monary dysplasia)?
 • Did the toddler choke on a carrot or other food a few months ago?
 • Did the child have respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bronchiolitis, 
or rhinovirus infection as an infant?
 • Did the child receive a bone marrow transplant?
 • Is the child fully immunized?
 • Did the infant have a tracheoesophageal fistula repaired in the neo­
natal period?

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
Physical Examination
Inspection
Initial inspection often reveals the seriousness of an illness:
 • Is the child struggling to breathe (dyspnea)?
 • Does the child have an anxious look?
 • Is the child in respiratory distress?
 • Can the child be calmed or engaged in play?
 • Are there audible respiratory sounds?
 • Is the child’s skin blue (representing cyanosis) or ashen?
 • Does the child appear wasted, with poor growth that may indicate a 
chronic illness?
The respiratory rate is often elevated with parenchymal lung dis­
ease or extrathoracic airway obstruction. Respiratory rates vary with 
the age of the child (Fig. 3.3) and with pulmonary infection, airway 
obstruction, activity, wakefulness and sleep, fever, metabolic acidosis, 
and anxiety.
Odors may also give helpful clues. Does the examining room or the 
clothing smell of stale cigarette smoke? Is there a foul odor from a dia­
per with a fatty stool, which may suggest pancreatic insufficiency and 
CF? Is the child’s breath malodorous, as can be noticed in sinusitis, 
nasal foreign body, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis?
Fingers. Cyanotic nail beds suggest hypoxemia, poor peripheral 
circulation, or both. The examiner looks for the presence of digital 
clubbing (Fig. 3.4), which makes asthma or acute pneumonia extremely 
unlikely. The absence of digital clubbing but a history of severe chronic 
cough in an older child makes CF unlikely.
Chest, abdomen, and spine. The shape of the chest gives 
information. Is the anteroposterior (AP) diameter increased, which 
indicates hyperinflation of the lungs from obstruction of small airways 
(e.g., asthma, bronchiolitis, CF)? Is this diameter small, as can be seen 
with some restrictive lung diseases with small lung volumes (e.g., 
muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy)? The normal infant 
has a “round” chest configuration, with the AP diameter of the chest 
about 84% of the transverse (lateral) diameter. With growth, the chest 
becomes more flattened in the AP dimension, and the AP-­to-­transverse 
ratio is between 70% and 75%. Although obstetric calipers can be used

CHAPTER 3  Cough
to give an objective assessment of the AP diameter of the chest, most 
clinicians rely on their subjective assessment of whether the diameter 
is increased: does the patient look “barrel-­chested”?
Intercostal, subcostal, suprasternal, and supraclavicular retractions 
(inspiratory sinking in of the soft tissues) indicate increased effort of 
breathing and reflect both the contraction of the accessory muscles of 
respiration and the resulting difference between intrapleural and extra­
thoracic pressure. Retractions occur most commonly with obstructed 
airways (upper or lower), but they may occur with any condition lead­
ing to the use of the accessory muscles. Any retractions other than the 
mild normal depressions seen between an infant’s lower ribs indicate 
a greater-­than-­normal work of breathing. Audible end-­expiratory 
“grunting” is suggestive of alveolar fluid from pulmonary, cardiac, or 
inflammation; it is often associated with severe disease.
Less easy to notice than intercostal retractions is their bulging out 
with expiration in a child with expiratory obstruction (asthma). Con­
traction of the abdominal muscles with expiration is easier to notice 
and is another indication that a child is working harder than normal to 
push air out through obstructed airways.
Inspection of the spine may reveal kyphosis or scoliosis. There is a 
risk of restrictive lung disease if the curvature is severe.
Palpation
Palpating the trachea, particularly in infants, may reveal a shift to one 
side, which suggests loss of volume of the lung on that side or extrapul­
monary gas (pneumothorax) on the other side. Placing one hand on each 
side of the chest while the patient breathes may enable the examiner to 
detect asymmetry of chest wall movement, either in timing or in degree 
of expansion. The former indicates a partial bronchial obstruction, and 
the latter suggests a smaller lung volume, voluntary guarding, or dimin­
ished muscle function on one side. Palpating the abdomen gently during 
expiration may allow the examiner to feel the contraction of the abdom­
inal muscles in cases of expiratory obstruction. Hyperinflation may push 
the liver down, making it palpable below the costal margin.

vibrations), helps determine areas of increased parenchymal density 
and hence increased fremitus (as in pneumonic consolidation) or 
decreased fremitus (as in pneumothorax or pleural effusion).
Percussion
The percussion determined by the examiner’s tapping of one middle 
finger on the middle finger of the other hand, which is firmly placed 
over the patient’s thorax, may be dull over an area of consolidation or 
effusion and hyperresonant with air trapping. Percussion can also be 
used to determine diaphragmatic excursion. The lowest level of reso­
nance at inspiration and expiration determines diaphragmatic motion.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
Auscultation
Because lung sounds tend to be higher pitched than heart sounds, the 
diaphragm of the stethoscope is better suited to pulmonary ausculta­
tion than is the bell, whose target is primarily the lower-­pitched heart 
sounds (Table 3.6). The adult-­sized stethoscope generally is superior 
to the smaller pediatric or neonatal diaphragms, even for listening to 
small chests, because its acoustics are better (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6).
Adventitious sounds come in a few varieties, namely, stridor, crack­
les, rhonchi, and wheezes. Other sounds should be described in clear, 
everyday language.
 • Stridor is a continuous musical sound usually heard on inspiration 
and is caused by narrowing in the extrathoracic airway, as with 
croup or laryngomalacia.
 • Crackles are discontinuous, representing the popping open of air-­
fluid menisci as the airways dilate with inspiration. Fluid in larger 
airways causes crackles early in inspiration (congestive heart fail­
ure). Crackles that tend to be a bit lower in pitch (“coarse” crack­
les) than the early, higher-­pitched (“fine”) crackles are associated 
with fluid in small airways (pneumonia). Although crackles usually 
signal the presence of excess airway fluid (pneumonia, pulmonary 
edema), they may also be produced by the popping open of nonin­
fected fibrotic or atelectatic airways. Fine crackles are not audible 
at the mouth, whereas coarse crackles may be. Crackles is the pre­
ferred term, rather than the previously popular “rales.”
 • Rhonchi, or “large airway sounds,” are continuous gurgling or bub­
bling sounds typically heard during both inhalation and exhalation. 
These sounds are caused by movement of fluid and secretions in 
larger airways (in asthma, viral upper respiratory infection [URI]). 
Rhonchi, unlike other sounds, may clear with coughing.
 • Wheezes are continuous musical sounds (lasting longer than 
200 msec), caused by vibration of narrowed airway walls, as with 
asthma, and perhaps vibration of material within airway lumens.

The DPD/IPD ratio can be measured with calipers or, more accurately, 
with finger casts. The hyponychial angle is measured from lateral pro­
jections of the finger contour on a magnifying screen and is normally 
<180 degrees but >195 degrees with finger clubbing. Schamroth sign is 
useful for bedside assessment. The dorsal surfaces of the terminal pha­
langes of similar fingers are placed together. With clubbing, the normal 
diamond-­shaped aperture or “window” at the bases of the nail beds 
disappears, and a prominent distal angle forms between the end of the 
nails. In normal subjects, this angle is minimal or nonexistent. (From

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
These sounds are much more commonly heard during expiration 
than inspiration.
Diagnostic Studies
Radiography
The chest radiograph is often the most useful diagnostic test in the evalua­
tion of the child with cough. Table 3.7 highlights some of the radiographic 
features of the most common causes of cough in pediatric patients. Radio­
graphic findings are often similar for a number of disorders, and thus these 
studies may not indicate a definitive diagnosis. Chest radiographs are nor­
mal in children with psychogenic (habit) cough and in children with sinu­
sitis or gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the primary cause of cough. A 
normal chest radiograph indicates the unlikelihood of pneumonia caused 
by RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, Chlamydia species, or bacte­
ria. Although children with cough resulting from CF, Mycoplasma species, 
tuberculosis, aspiration, a bronchial foreign body, or an anatomic abnor­
mality usually have abnormal chest radiographs, a normal radiograph 
does not exclude these diagnoses. Hyperinflation of the lungs is commonly 
seen on chest radiographs of infants with RSV bronchiolitis or Chlamydia 
pneumonia, and a lobar or round (coin lesion) infiltrate is the radiographic 
hallmark of bacterial pneumonia. Normal sinuses on radiograph or CT 
scan exclude sinusitis. In some causes of cough, the chest x-­ray may be 
unrevealing; CT angiography is often very helpful in these circumstances, 
which may include COVID-­19, vaping injury, pulmonary embolism, 
bronchiectasis, granulomatous diseases, and diseases associated with hilar 
or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Fig. 3.6  Characteristics of breath sounds. Tracheal breath sounds are very harsh, loud, and high pitched; they 
are heard over the extrathoracic portion of the trachea. Bronchial breath sounds are loud and high pitched; 
normally, they are heard over the lower sternum and sound like air rushing through a tube. The expiratory com­
ponent is louder and longer than the inspiratory component; a definite pause is heard between the two phases. 
Bronchovesicular breath sounds are a mixture of bronchial and vesicular sounds. The inspiratory (I) and expira­
tory (E) components are equal in length. They are usually heard only in the first and second interspaces anteriorly 
and between the scapulae posteriorly, near the carina and mainstem bronchi. Vesicular breath sounds are soft 
and low pitched; they are heard over most of the lung fields. The inspiratory component is much longer than the 
expiratory component; the latter is softer and often inaudible. (From Swartz MH, ed. The chest. In: Textbook of 
Physical Diagnosis: History and Examination. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 1989.)

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
with 85% lymphocytes strongly suggests pertussis, but not every child 
with pertussis presents such a clear hematologic picture. The presence 
of a high number or large proportions of immature forms of WBCs sug­
gests an acute process, such as a bacterial infection. Immunoglobulins 
provide supportive evidence for a few diagnoses, such as chlamydial 
infection, which rarely occurs without elevated serum concentrations of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM).
Bacteriology/Virology
Specific bacteriologic or virologic diagnoses can be made in a number 
of disorders causing cough, including RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, 
coronaviruses, adenovirus, enteroviruses, metapneumovirus, Myco­
plasma, and Chlamydia pneumonia. In most cases, the viruses can be 
rapidly identified with amplification of the viral genome through poly­
merase chain reaction (PCR). In bacterial pneumonia, the offending 
organism can be cultured from the blood in a small proportion (10%) 
of patients. A positive culture provides definitive diagnosis, but a nega­
tive culture specimen is not helpful. Throat cultures are seldom helpful 
(except in CF) in identifying lower respiratory tract bacterial organ­
isms. Sputum cultures and Gram stains may help guide initial empir­
ical therapy in older children with pneumonia or purulent bronchitis, 
but their ability to identify specific causative organisms with certainty 
(with the exception of CF) has not been shown clearly.
Infants and young children usually do not expectorate but rather 
swallow their sputum. Specimens obtained via bronchoscopy may be 
contaminated by mouth flora, but heavy growth of a single organism 
from a bronchoalveolar lavage in the presence of polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils certainly supports the organism’s role in disease. If pleural 
fluid or fluid obtained directly from the lung via needle aspiration is 
cultured, the same rules apply: Positive cultures and nucleic acid ampli­
fication tests are definitive, but negative cultures are not.
Other Tests
A number of specific tests can help to establish diagnoses in a child 
with cough (see Table 3.7). These include a positive response to bron­
chodilators in a child with asthma; visualizing the red, swollen epiglot­
tis in epiglottitis (to be done only under very controlled conditions); 
the bronchoscopic visualization of the peanut, plastic toy, or other 
offender in foreign body aspiration; a positive purified protein deriva­
tive (PPD) or QuantiFERON assay in tuberculosis; and several studies 
of the esophagus in GER. Several imaging techniques, such as CT or 
MRI, can help to delineate various intrathoracic anatomic abnormal­
ities, pulmonary embolism, and bronchiectasis. Multiple tests can be 
employed to confirm the diagnosis of CF (Table 3.8).
Differential Diagnosis and Treatment
Infection
Infections are the most common cause of acute cough in all age groups 
and are responsible for some chronic coughs. The age of the patient has 
a large impact on the frequency of the type of infection.
Infections in infants. Viral upper respiratory infections (common 
cold); croup (laryngotracheobronchitis); viral bronchiolitis, particularly 
with RSV or human metapneumovirus; and viral pneumonia are the 
most frequently encountered respiratory tract infections and hence the 
most common causes of cough in infancy. Viral illness may predispose to 
bacterial superinfection (e.g., croup and Staphylococcus aureus tracheitis 
or influenza and Haemophilus influenzae or S. aureus pneumonia).
Viral upper respiratory infections. Viral URI symptoms and 
signs usually include nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, 
and sneezing. There may be fever, constitutional signs (irritability, 
myalgias, and headache), or both. Cough is common and may persist 
for 5–7 days. The mechanism by which URIs cause cough in children 
is undetermined. In adults, it is generally thought that “postnasal 
drip”—that is, nasal or sinus secretions draining into the posterior 
nasopharynx—causes cough and, in fact, may be one of the most 
frequent causes of cough. Indeed, sinus CT in older patients with 
URIs often reveals unexpected involvement of the sinus mucosa. 
Other authorities believe that cough in a child with a URI indicates 
involvement (inflammation or bronchospasm) of the lower respiratory 
tract. Over-­the-­counter cough and cold medications are commonly 
used. Evidence of efficacy of these medications for children with URI 
is lacking. Because of the known risk for unintentional overdose from 
these medications, their use is not recommended in children under age 
4 years.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
Common viral pathogens include rhinovirus, RSV, coronaviruses, 
and parainfluenza viruses. The differential diagnosis includes allergic 
rhinitis, which often demonstrates clear nasal secretions with eosino­
phils and pale nasal mucosa, and sinusitis, which presents with muco­
purulent nasal secretions containing neutrophils and erythematous 
mucosa.
Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). Infectious croup (see Chapter 
4) is most common in the first 2 years of life. Its most dramatic 
components are the barking (“croupy”) cough and inspiratory stridor, 
which appear a few days after the onset of a cold. In most cases, the 
patient has a low-­grade fever, and the disease resolves within a day or 
two. In severe cases, the child can be extremely ill and is at risk for 
complete laryngeal obstruction. There may be marked intercostal and 
suprasternal retractions and cyanosis. Stridor at rest signifies significant 
obstruction. Diminishing stridor in a child who is calm is a good sign, 
but diminishing stridor in and of itself is not necessarily good: If the 
child becomes fatigued because of the tremendous work of breathing 
through an obstructed airway and can no longer breathe effectively, 
smaller-­than-­needed tidal volumes make less noise.
It is important to distinguish croup from epiglottitis in the child 
with harsh, barking cough and inspiratory stridor because the nat­
ural histories of the two diseases are quite different (see Table 3.7). 
Epiglottitis is uncommon but occurs in unimmunized patients (see 
Chapter 4).
Treatment of mild croup is usually not needed. For decades, pedi­
atricians have recommended putting a child with croup in a steamy 
bathroom or driving to the office or emergency department with the 
car windows rolled down. It is likely that these remedies are effective 
because of the heat exchange properties of the upper airway; air that 
is cooler or more humid than the airway mucosa will serve to cool the 
mucosa, thus causing local vasoconstriction and probably decreasing 
local edema.
In a child who has stridor at rest, evaluation is indicated. Symptom­
atic, often dramatic relief through decreased laryngeal edema can usu­
ally be achieved with aerosolized racemic epinephrine (2.25% solution, 
0.25 to 0.5 mL/dose). It is essential to remember that the effects of the 
epinephrine are transient, lasting only a few hours, although the course 
of the illness is often longer. The result is that when the racemic epi­
nephrine’s effect has worn off, the child’s cough and stridor will proba­
bly be as bad or even worse than before the aerosol was administered. 
This is not a “rebound” effect: The symptoms are not worse because 
of the treatment but, rather, because of the natural progression of the 
viral illness. Repeating the aerosol will probably again have a beneficial 
effect. A child who responds favorably to such an aerosol needs to be 
observed for several hours because further treatment may be needed. 
A single dose of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg orally, intramuscularly, or 
intravenously, maximum dose 16 mg) reduces the severity and hastens 
recovery.
Bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is a common and potentially serious 
lower respiratory tract disorder in infants (see Chapter 4). It is caused 
usually by RSV but on occasion by parainfluenza, influenza, human 
metapneumovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, and human rhinovirus. 
It mostly occurs in the winter months, often in epidemics. RSV 
bronchiolitis is seen uncommonly in children older than 4 years. 
Typically, “coldlike” symptoms of rhinorrhea precede the harsh cough, 
increased respiratory rate, and retractions. Respiratory distress and 
cyanosis can be severe. The child’s temperature is seldom elevated 
above 38°C.
The chest is hyperinflated, widespread crackles are audible on inspi­
ration, and wheezing marks expiration. The chest radiograph invari­
ably reveals hyperinflation, as depicted by a depressed diaphragm, 
with an enlarged retrosternal air space in as many as 60% of patients, 
peribronchial thickening in approximately 50%, and consolidation 
and/or atelectasis in 10–25%.
The diagnosis is confirmed with demonstration of RSV by PCR 
of nasopharyngeal secretions. In most cases, no treatment is needed 
because the disease does not interfere with the infant’s eating or breath­
ing. Apnea is a common complication of RSV bronchiolitis in neonates 
and may necessitate close monitoring. In severe cases, often those in 
which there is underlying chronic heart, lung, or immunodeficiency 
disease, RSV can be life threatening. In severe cases, hospital care with 
supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids is indicated. Suctioning of 
secretions is an essential part of the treatment. Many other treatment 
modalities have been tried for hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. 
Aerosolized bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids do not seem 
to alter clinical outcome and are not recommended in most patients. 
Nebulized saline may reduce the length of hospitalization. Use of a 
high-­flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for more invasive forms 
of respiratory support in infants with impending respiratory failure.
Viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can be similar to bronchiolitis 
in its manifestation, with cough and tachypnea, after a few days of 
apparent URI. There can be variable degrees of fever and of overall 
illness. Infants and children with viral pneumonia may appear relatively 
well or, particularly with coronavirus, adenovirus, or influenza, may 
have a rapidly progressive course. Frequent symptoms include poor 
feeding, cough, cyanosis, fever (some patients may be afebrile), 
apnea, and rhinorrhea. Frequent signs include tachypnea, retractions, 
crackles, and cough. Cyanosis is less common.
The most common agents causing viral pneumonia in infancy and 
childhood are RSV, influenza, and parainfluenza. Adenovirus is less com­
mon, but it is important because it can be severe and cause residual lung 
disease, including bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans. Adenovi­
rus pneumonia is often accompanied by conjunctivitis and pharyngitis, 
in addition to leukocytosis and an elevated ESR; the ESR and leukocyte 
count are usually not elevated in other types of viral pneumonia. Addi­
tional viral agents include enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, and 
rhinovirus. Radiographs most often reveal diffuse, bilateral peribronchial 
infiltrates, with a predilection for the perihilar regions, but occasionally 
lobar infiltrates are present. Pleural effusions are not common. Human 
coronaviruses account for 5–10% of acute upper respiratory infections 
in adults; infants with coronaviruses often have coinfections with other 
respiratory viruses and may not have respiratory symptoms, suggesting 
that some endemic coronaviruses may have low pathogenicity in healthy 
infants. Older children and adolescents are at risk for severe pneumonia 
from severe acute respiratory syndrome-­coronavirus 2 (SARS-­CoV-2), 
which causes COVID-­19 (see later and Chapter 4). Vaccination is now 
available for COVID-19.
Treatment is largely supportive, with oxygen and intravenous flu­
ids. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in a small minority of 
infants.
Pertussis (whooping cough). Pertussis is a relatively common 
cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, children, 
adolescents, and adults, especially in those who are underimmunized 
or not immunized. The causative organism, Bordetella pertussis, has 
a tropism for tracheal and bronchial ciliated epithelial cells; thus, the 
disease is primarily bronchitis, but spread of the organism to alveoli, 
or secondary invasion by other bacteria, can cause pneumonia. The 
disease can occur at any age, from early infancy onward, although its 
manifestations in young infants and in those who have been partially 
immunized may be atypical; infants may present with apnea and 
minimal or no cough.
Most commonly, pertussis has three stages:
 • Catarrhal, in which symptoms are indistinguishable from a viral 
URI

36
SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
 • Paroxysmal, dominated by repeated forceful, paroxysmal coughing 
spells; spells may be punctuated by an inspiratory “whoop,” post-­
tussive emesis, or both
 • Convalescent, in which the intensity and frequency of coughing 
spells gradually diminish
Each stage typically lasts 1–2 weeks, except the paroxysmal stage, 
which lasts many weeks. (Pertussis is known as the “100-­day cough” in 
China.) Most children are entirely well between coughing spells, when 
physical findings are remarkably benign. The paroxysmal cough recurs 
with subsequent respiratory illnesses for many months after illness. 
Infants younger than 6 months of age are at highest risk for compli­
cations. The majority of infants with pertussis need to be hospitalized.
Diagnosis can be difficult because the definitive result—namely, cul­
turing the organism from nasopharyngeal secretions—requires special 
culture medium (Bordet-­Gengou, which must be prepared fresh for each 
collection). Culture specimens are much less likely to be positive during 
the paroxysmal stage than during the catarrhal stage, when the diagno­
sis is not being considered. PCR assay of an adequate nasopharyngeal 
(NP) specimen is the most commonly used test because of improved 
sensitivity and faster turnaround time compared to culture. An elevated 
WBC count, as high as 20,000–50,000, with lymphocytes predominating 
is suggestive of pertussis in infants and children but often absent in ado­
lescents. Chest radiographic findings are nonspecific.
Treatment is largely supportive, with oxygen; fluids; and small, fre­
quent feedings for patients who do not tolerate their normal feedings. 
Treatment with azithromycin decreases infectivity and may ameliorate 
the course of the disease if given during the catarrhal stage.
Complications include those related to severe coughing (Table 3.9) 
and those specific to pertussis, such as seizures and encephalopathy. The 
risk of acquiring pertussis is markedly reduced by immunizations (three 
primary immunizations and regular booster immunizations). Neither 
pertussis infection nor immunization produces lifelong immunity.
Chlamydial infection. Chlamydia trachomatis can cause pneumonia 
in young infants following acquisition from the maternal genitourinary 
tract, particularly those aged 3–12 weeks. Cough, nasal congestion, 
low-­grade or no fever, and tachypnea are common. Conjunctivitis is 
an important clue to chlamydial disease but is present in only 50% of 
infants with chlamydial pneumonia at the time of presentation. Affected 
infants may have a paroxysmal cough similar to that of pertussis, but 
post-­tussive emesis is less common. Crackles are commonly heard on 
auscultation, but wheezing is much less common than the overinflated 
appearance of the lungs on radiographs would suggest. The organism 
may be recovered from the nasopharynx by culture or antigen testing. 
The CBC may reveal eosinophilia. Chlamydial infection responds to 
oral erythromycin or azithromycin therapy.
In young infants, the afebrile pneumonia syndrome may be caused by 
Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, or Mycoplasma species; cytomegalovirus; or Pneu­
mocystis jirovecii. In this syndrome, cough and tachypnea are common. 
Severe pneumonia may develop in neonates as a result of herpes simplex.
Ureaplasmal infection. Ureaplasma urealyticum pneumonia 
is difficult to diagnose but causes cough in some infants. There are 
no particularly outstanding features to distinguish this relatively 
uncommon infection from viral pneumonias.
Bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is less common in 
infants than is viral pneumonia but can cause severe illness, with 
cough, respiratory distress, and fever. Chest radiographs are abnormal, 
and the WBC count is elevated.
Treatment is with antibiotics effective against pneumococci, group 
A streptococci, and, if illness is severe, S. aureus.
Infections in toddlers and children
Viral URIs. In early childhood, as children attend daycare and nurs­
ery schools, they are constantly exposed to respiratory viruses to which 
they have little or no immunity (e.g., RSV, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, 
parainfluenza, and enteroviruses). Young children may have as many as 
six to eight or even more URIs in a year. The remarks concerning colds 
and cough in infants (see previous discussion) apply to this older age 
group. The differential diagnosis of rhinorrhea is noted in Table 3.10.
Sinusitis. The sinuses may become the site for viral and subsequent 
secondary bacterial infection spreading from the nasopharynx 
(Fig. 3.7). The signs and symptoms are usually localized, including 
nasal congestion, a feeling of “fullness” or pain in the face (Fig. 3.8), 
headache, sinus tenderness, day or night cough, and fever. Maxillary 
toothache, purulent nasal discharge for more than 10 days, and 
positive transillumination (opacification) are important clues. Sinus 
radiographs or (more accurate) a CT scan may facilitate the diagnosis 
of sinusitis by demonstrating opacification of the sinus with mucosal 
thickening. Sinusitis is thought to be a cause of cough in adults and can 
probably be listed, with lower certainty, as a cause of cough in children.
Sinusitis is frequently seen in other conditions known to cause cough, 
especially CF, asthma, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis with or without eosinophilia. It may be difficult to ascertain 
whether the cough is a direct result of the sinus infection or the underly­
ing problem (purulent bronchitis in the child with CF or ciliary dyskine­
sia, exacerbation of asthma). In the first two situations, it may not matter 
because treatment is the same. In the case of the child with asthma, it is 
important to treat the asthma with bronchodilating and antiinflammatory 
agents, as well as to treat the infected sinuses with antibiotics.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
The treatment of sinusitis involves the use of oral antibiotics active 
against the common pathogens (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, non­
typable H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and, in rare cases, anaero­
bic bacteria or Streptococcus pyogenes). Treatment regimens include the 
use of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-­clavulanate, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or 
cefdinir. Amoxicillin is considered the initial agent of choice. Oral (pseu­
doephedrine, phenylephrine) or topical (phenylephrine, oxymetazoline) 
decongestants may be of benefit by increasing the patency of the sinus 
ostia, which permits drainage of the infected and obstructed sinuses. 
Oral antihistamines may benefit patients with an allergic history. Treat­
ment with antimicrobial agents should continue for at least 7 days after 
the patient has responded. This may require 14–21 days of therapy. Many 
patients with presumed sinusitis recover without antibiotic therapy.
Complications of acute sinusitis include orbital cellulitis, abscesses 
(orbital, cerebral), cranial (frontal) osteomyelitis (Pott puffy tumor), empy­
ema (subdural, epidural), and thrombosis (sagittal or cavernous sinus).

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
Protracted bacterial bronchitis. Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) 
is a cause of chronic, productive cough in young children. Suggested 
clinical criteria include a productive cough for at least 4 weeks, no 
other symptoms, normal spirometry, normal chest x-­ray (but may have 
peribronchial thickening), and possible improvement/resolution after 
2 weeks of antibiotics. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis 
may be the most common pathogens. Treatment of PBB requires an 
initial 2-­week course of an appropriate antibiotic, with the preferred 
choice being amoxicillin-­clavulanate. If cough persists, a more prolonged 
antibiotic course may be needed (up to 4 weeks). Bronchoscopy with 
bronchoalveolar lavage may help guide antibiotic treatment, particularly 
in those with refractory cough despite 4 weeks of antibiotics.
Pneumonia. The features discussed for viral pneumonia in infants 
are relevant for viral pneumonia in older children. The differentiation 
of viral or atypical pneumonia from classical bacterial pneumonia is 
noted in Table 3.11. Adenovirus and influenza pneumonia may present 
similar to bacterial pneumonia in severity and acuteness and with 
elevated acute-­phase reactants (ESR, CRP, procalcitonin). Etiology 
clues are noted in Tables 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. Bacterial pneumonia 
is more common in toddlers and older children than in infants. The 
most common pathogen is S. pneumoniae (see Table 3.12). Cough may 
not be as prominent a presenting symptom or sign as tachypnea and 
grunting. Raised respiratory rates (>50 in infants 2–12 months old, 
>40 in children 1–5 years old) plus retractions and grunting with or 
without hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <90%) have a high specificity 
and sensitivity for pneumonia. Chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, 
or any combination of these symptoms may occur. Upper lobe 
pneumonia may produce meningeal signs, and lower lobe involvement 
may cause abdominal pain and an ileus.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
Examination of the chest shows tachypnea but may be otherwise 
surprisingly normal. In older children, there may be localized dullness 
to percussion, with crackles or amphoric (bronchial) breath sounds 
over a consolidated lobe. The chest radiograph may be normal in the 
first hours of the illness, inasmuch as the radiographic findings often 
lag behind the clinical manifestations. Nonetheless, both anterior-­
posterior and lateral views are the main diagnostic tools; lobar consoli­
dation is usual, with or without pleural effusion. In infants, the pattern 
may be more diffuse and extensive.
Some clinical and radiographic features may be suggestive of the 
bacterial cause of pneumonia. Children (especially infants) with staph­
ylococcal pneumonia are more likely to have a rapid, overwhelming 
course. Staphylococcal pneumonia may be accompanied by more 
extensive radiographic abnormalities, including multilobar consolida­
tion, pneumatocele formation, and extensive pleural (empyema) fluid 
(Fig. 3.9). The presence of a pleural effusion is not helpful in indicat­
ing the specific bacterial diagnosis because other bacterial pneumonias 
may be accompanied by pleural effusion (Fig. 3.10). Pleural effusions 
may represent a reactive parapneumonic effusion or an empyema. 
Pleural fluid may be characterized as transudate, exudate, or empyema 
(Table 3.15). If the effusion is of sufficient size, as demonstrated by a 
lateral decubitus radiograph or ultrasonography, a thoracentesis may 
be indicated to differentiate the nature of the effusion and to identify 
possible pathogens. For young children who require sedation for tho­
racentesis and who have an effusion needing drainage, a primary chest 
tube placement is preferred over thoracentesis due to the risks of mul­
tiple procedures with sedation.
Differentiating among the causes of bacterial pneumonia can be 
done with certainty only with positive cultures from blood, pleural 
fluid (including PCR testing), or, in rare cases, sputum. Current or pre­
vious antibiotic treatment diminishes the yield of such cultures. Bron­
choscopy with or without lavage may yield helpful specimens from the 
progressively ill child or the child who has not responded promptly to 
empirical antibiotics.
Treatment of uncomplicated presumed bacterial pneumonia is with 
antibiotics. Ampicillin is the drug of choice for the previously healthy

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
child who requires hospitalization with lobar pneumonia who is fully 
immunized. If the child is not fully immunized, ceftriaxone is indi­
cated. For the critically ill child, vancomycin and ceftriaxone may be 
considered for possible drug-­resistant S. pneumoniae and methicillin-­
resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Many children with pneumonia do well 
with oral antibiotics and respond within hours to the first dose. 
Repeated or follow-­up chest radiographs may remain abnormal for 
4–6 weeks after appropriate treatment and are not indicated for a single 
episode of uncomplicated pneumonia (i.e., no effusion, no abscess, and 
good response to treatment).
Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia among 
school-­aged children. The disease often occurs in community outbreaks 
in the fall. The illness typically begins with extrapulmonary symptoms 
(i.e., sore throat, myalgias, headache, fever), which then progress to 
include cough, which can be paroxysmal at times. Patients do not often 
appear acutely ill, but cough may persist for weeks. There may be no 
specific abnormalities on the chest examination, although a few crackles 
may be heard, and about one third of younger patients wheeze.
The radiographic findings in mycoplasma pneumonia can mimic 
almost any intrathoracic disease; scattered infiltrates with nonspecific 
“dirty” lung fields, predominantly perihilar or lower lobes, are com­
mon, and lobar infiltrates and pleural effusion are occasionally seen. 
Laboratory data (CBC, ESR, sputum culture) may not be helpful. A 
rise in anti-­mycoplasma IgG over 1–2 weeks may be demonstrated but 
is seldom helpful in guiding therapy. A positive IgM response may be 
useful, although it can persist in serum for several months and, conse­
quently, may not indicate current infection. PCR is the most helpful test. 
The cold agglutinin test yields positive results in about 70% of patients 
with mycoplasma pneumonia, but they are also positive in other con­
ditions, including adenovirus infection. The more severe the illness is, 
the greater is the frequency of positive cold agglutinins. The diagnosis 
is often made from the history of an older child who has a lingering 
coughing illness in the setting of a community outbreak, unresponsive 
to most (non-­erythromycin) antibiotic regimens.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
in children 8 years old or older usually shortens the course of illness. 
Extrapulmonary complications of mycoplasma infection include asep­
tic meningitis, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuropathy, erythema 
multiforme, myocarditis, pericarditis, hemolytic anemia, and bullous 
otitis media (myringitis). In patients with sickle cell anemia, severe 
respiratory failure and acute chest syndrome may develop. Infection 
with Chlamydia pneumoniae mimics respiratory disease resulting 
from M. pneumoniae, inasmuch as it occurs in epidemics, is seen in 
older children, and produces an atypical pneumonia syndrome and 
pharyngitis.
Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is uncommon in developed countries; 
95% of the disease burden worldwide is in developing countries. 
Tuberculosis must be considered in the child with chest disease that is 
not easily explained by other diagnoses, especially if the child lives in 
or has migrated from an endemic area of the world or has been exposed 
to an adult with active tuberculosis. Nonetheless, tuberculosis is an 
infrequent cause of cough in children, even in those with active disease.
The diagnosis is made primarily by skin testing (purified protein 
derivative [PPD]) or a positive QuantiFERON test; a history of contact 
with a person who has tuberculosis; and recovery of the organism from

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural fluid or biopsy, or morning 
gastric aspirates (Table 3.16). The yield from these procedures is rela­
tively low, even from children with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
The patterns of disease in normal hosts include primary pulmo­
nary tuberculosis, with subsequent inactivation usually noted in 
young children and reactivation of pulmonary disease among adoles­
cents. Primary pulmonary disease is often noted as a lower or mid­
dle lobe infiltrate during the period of T-­lymphocyte reaction to the 
initial infection. Before resolution, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
infection may disseminate to the better-­oxygenated upper lobes and 
extrathoracic sites, such as bone, or the central nervous system. If the 
immune response contains the initial infection, the radiographic find­
ings may be indistinguishable from those of any other pneumonic pro­
cess. In some young patients or those with altered immune function, 
however, there may be progressive disease, dissemination to miliary 
pulmonary disease, or early reactivation (months to 5 years) at distal 
sites, which produces tuberculous meningitis or osteomyelitis. Reac­
tivation of upper lobe pulmonary disease may produce cavities that 
are similar to the disease among adults. Cavitary and endobronchial 
lymph node involvement are highly infectious, in contrast to the much 
less contagious nature of the hypersensitivity reaction noted in primary 
pulmonary disease.
Aspiration
Inhaling food, mouth or gastric secretions, or foreign bodies into 
the tracheobronchial tree causes acute, recurrent, or chronic cough. 
Interference with normal swallowing disrupts the coordination of 
swallowing and breathing that prevents aspiration. Structural causes 
of disordered swallowing include repaired or unrepaired esophageal 
atresia, strictures, webs, or congenital stenoses. Mediastinal lesions 
(tumors, lymph nodes), including vascular rings, may compromise the 
esophageal lumen and esophageal peristalsis, increasing the likelihood 
of aspiration. Functional disorders include central nervous system dys­
function or immaturity, dysautonomia, achalasia, and diffuse esoph­
ageal spasm. Prior neck surgery, including tracheostomy, may alter 
normal swallowing. Tracheoesophageal fistula and laryngeal clefts are 
congenital malformations with direct physical connections between 
the tracheobronchial tree and the upper gastrointestinal tract; thus, 
oral contents enter the lungs directly.
Making the diagnosis of aspiration as the cause of cough may be dif­
ficult. Barium contrast studies during swallowing may help character­
ize these disorders if barium enters the trachea. Because most patients 
aspirate sporadically, a normal barium swallow does not rule out aspi­
ration. Radionuclide studies can be helpful if ingested radiolabeled 
milk or formula is demonstrated over the lung fields at several-­hour 
intervals after the meal. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage that 
recover large numbers of lipid-­laden macrophages suggest that aspira­
tion has taken place; however, the finding is neither sensitive nor spe­
cific for aspiration.
Treatment depends largely on the cause of aspiration. Because many 
patients who aspirate do so because of lack of neurologic control of 
swallowing and breathing, it is often difficult to prevent. Even gastros­
tomy feedings cannot prevent aspiration of oral secretions. In extreme 
cases, tracheostomy with ligation of the proximal trachea has been 
employed. This not only prevents aspiration but also prevents phona­
tion, and it must be considered only in unusual situations. Aspiration 
pneumonia is often treated with intravenous ampicillin-­sulbactam or 
clindamycin to cover mouth flora of predominant anaerobes. Addi­
tional coverage against gram-­negative organisms may be indicated if 
the aspiration is nosocomial.
Foreign Body
Any child with cough of abrupt onset should be suspected of having 
inhaled a foreign body into the airway. Toddlers, who by nature put all 
types of things into their mouths and who have incompletely matured 
swallowing and airway protective mechanisms, are at high risk. Infants 
with toddlers or young children in the household who may “feed” the 
baby are also at risk. In older children, it is usually possible to obtain an 
accurate history of the aspiration event. These events are described as 
choking, gagging, and coughing while something (e.g., peanuts, pop­
corn, small toys, sunflower seeds) is in the mouth. However, in toddlers, 
∼50% may have no witnessed history of gagging. The child may come

CHAPTER 3  Cough
to the physician with cough and wheeze immediately after the event, 
with a clear history and a straightforward diagnosis. In many children 
with a tracheobronchial foreign body, however, the initial episode is 
not recognized; these children may not come to medical attention for 
days, weeks, or even months. The initial episode may be followed by a 
relatively symptom-­free period lasting days or even weeks, until infec­
tion develops behind an obstructed segmental or lobar bronchus. At 
this point, cough, perhaps with hemoptysis, with or without wheeze, 
recurs.
On physical examination early after an aspiration episode, there is 
cough, wheeze, or both, often with asymmetry of auscultatory find­
ings. There may be locally diminished breath sounds. Later, localized 
wheeze or crackles may be detected. The triad of wheezing, coughing, 
and decreased breath sounds is present in fewer than 50% of patients. 
The presence of laryngotracheal foreign bodies often manifests with 
stridor, retractions, aphonia, cough, and normal radiographs.
Chest radiographs may be normal in 15% of patients with intra­
thoracic foreign bodies but should be obtained in both inspiration and 
expiration because in some cases the only abnormality is unilateral 
or unilobar air trapping, which is occasionally more clearly identified 
with an expiratory radiograph. In this view, an overdistended lung 
that had appeared normal on the inspiratory view does not empty, but 
the normal, unobstructed lung empties normally. This phenomenon 
causes a shift of the mediastinum toward the emptying lung, away from 
the side with the obstructing foreign body (Fig. 3.11). In other patients, 
localized infiltrate or atelectasis may be present behind the obstructing 
object. In a few patients, it may be possible to identify the foreign body 
itself; nonetheless, most inhaled food particles are not radiopaque and 
cannot be seen on radiographs. Aspiration is usually unilateral (80%); 
50–60% of the objects are in the right lung (the lobe depends on body 
position—supine vs standing—but is often the right middle lobe). The 
definitive diagnostic and therapeutic maneuver is bronchoscopy; either 
the flexible or rigid bronchoscope enables direct visualization of the 
object; the rigid instrument also enables its removal.
Gastroesophageal Reflux
GER is a common cause of cough in all age groups (see Chapter 15). 
The typical patient is an infant in the first 6 months of life who spits 
up small amounts frequently after feedings. This “regurgitant reflux” 
most commonly resolves by 1 year of age. However, many toddlers and 
children continue to have reflux, although it may be “silent” or nonre­
gurgitant (without spitting up).
In most people with GER, it is merely a nuisance or not noticed. In 
some there are sequelae, and this condition is designated gastroesoph­
ageal reflux disease (GERD). One manifestation is cough; the mecha­
nisms for the cough are not fully understood. Aspiration of refluxed 
material is one mechanism for cough but is probably not very common 
in neurologically intact children. A major mechanism for GERD with 
cough is mediated by vagal esophagobronchial reflexes (bronchocon­
striction), stimulated by acid in the esophagus. Whether acid in the

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
esophagus is sufficient stimulus to cause bronchoconstriction by itself 
or whether it merely heightens bronchial reactivity to other stimuli is 
not yet clear. Many children with asthma have cough or wheeze that 
is difficult to control until their concurrent GER is also treated. Many 
episodes of cough caused by GERD occur in children with asthma that 
is difficult to control.
The diagnosis of GERD must also be considered in the child with 
chronic or recurrent cough with no other obvious explanation. The 
child who coughs after meals or at night, when the supine position may 
provoke GER, should be evaluated for GER. If GER is confirmed, the 
next step is a therapeutic trial of antireflux therapy.
Treatment in a child whose cough is related to GER may be 
accomplished by treating the reflux (see Chapter 15) or by a combina­
tion of antireflux and antiasthma treatment. On occasion, the cough 
may be abolished by stopping all antiasthma medications. In such 
cases, the cough was a manifestation of bronchospasm with esoph­
ageal acidification as the trigger for bronchospasm; the esophageal 
acidification was caused by the bronchodilator effects on the lower 
esophageal sphincter.
Asthma
Cough is frequently the sole or most prominent manifestation of 
asthma; wheezing may be entirely absent. In fact, asthma is almost 
certainly the most common cause of recurrent and chronic cough 
in childhood (see Chapter 4). Some of the features that characterize 
the cough of a child with asthma are listed in Table 3.17. Treatment 
for asthma manifesting as cough is the same as the treatment for 
asthma.

CF is a common cause of recurrent or chronic cough in infancy and 
childhood. CF occurs in 1 in 2,000–3,000 live births among White 
persons, is far less common among African Americans (1 in 15,000), 
and is rare among Native Americans and Asians. Early diagnosis 
improves the prognosis for untreated CF; if untreated, many patients 
die in infancy or early childhood. The median length of survival is in 
the upper 30s; based on 2018 CF Patient Registry data, the median life 
expectancy of people with CF who are born between 2014 and 2018 is 
predicted to be 44 years. Of children born in 2018, half are predicted to 
survive to 47 years or older.
CF is a genetic disorder, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. 
The CF gene is on the long arm of chromosome 7; more than 1,900 
gene variants have been identified at the CF locus. Of these variants, 
one (ΔF508, indicating a deletion, Δ, of a single phenylalanine, F, at 
position 508 of the protein product) is the most common, responsible 
for 70–75% of all CF chromosomes. The variant affects the gene’s pro­
tein product, termed cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), 
which acts as a chloride channel and affects other aspects of membrane 
transport of ions and water. Not all the consequences of the defective 
gene and protein have been determined. In general, however, the defec­
tive gene product results in the long-­observed clinical manifestations 
of the disease, including thick, viscid mucus in the tracheobronchial 
tree, leading to purulent bronchiolitis and bronchitis with subsequent 
bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure; pancreatic 
duct obstruction, leading to pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea 
and failure to thrive; and abnormally high sweat chloride and sodium 
concentrations. The airway disease in CF is characterized by infection, 
inflammation, and endobronchial obstruction. The infection begins 
with S. aureus, H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or

CHAPTER 3  Cough
combinations of these organisms but eventually is dominated by non­
mucoid or mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms, such 
as Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Alcaligenes 
xylosoxidans, Aspergillus fumigatus, or nontuberculous mycobacte­
ria may also appear. In some patients, B. cepacia has been associated 
with rapid deterioration and death, and in others, Aspergillus species 
has caused allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The air­
way inflammation in all patients with CF appears to be the result of 
endogenous toxic substances, including elastase, released by neutro­
phils as they respond to the endobronchial infection and by exogenous 
enzymes released by the invading organisms.
CF may manifest at birth with meconium ileus (20% of patients), or 
later, with steatorrhea and failure to thrive despite a voracious appetite, 
in an apparent effort to make up for the calories that are lost in the 
stool (see Chapter 12). The most common presenting symptom after 
the newborn period is cough, which may appear within the first weeks 
of life or may be delayed for decades. The cough can be dry, productive, 
or paroxysmal. Cough may respond to antibiotics or perhaps steroids, 
but it is less likely to improve with bronchodilators (see Tables 3.3 and 
3.5). Because CF is a recessive genetic disease, there is often no family 
history. Furthermore, in atypical cases, patients may not have pancre­
atic insufficiency (∼10% of patients) and thus may not demonstrate 
steatorrhea and failure to thrive. In addition, malabsorption may not 
be evident in the neonatal period.
There is no such thing as a child who looks “too good” to have 
CF; common abnormalities found on physical examination are noted 
in Table 3.18. One of the most important physical findings is digital 
clubbing. In most patients with CF, clubbing develops within the first 
few years of life. Although the list of conditions associated with digital 
clubbing (Table 3.19) is long, they are less common than CF, or the 
incidence of digital clubbing with these conditions is low. There is some 
relationship between the degree of pulmonary disease severity and the 
degree of digital clubbing. A child who has had years of severe respira­
tory symptoms without digital clubbing is not likely to have CF.
The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive sweat chloride test or con­
firming the presence of two CF variants on chromosome 7. The sweat 
test, if not performed correctly in a laboratory with extensive experi­
ence with the technique (as, for example, in an accredited CF center), 
yields many false-­positive and false-­negative results. The proper tech­
nique is to use quantitative analysis of the concentration of chloride in 
the sweat produced after pilocarpine iontophoretic stimulation. Chlo­
ride concentration ≥60 mmol/L is considered positive, ≤29 mmol/L is 
negative (normal), and 30–59 mmol/L is intermediate, suggestive of 
possible CF, and requires further evaluation, including a repeat sweat 
test and CFTR gene sequencing. Healthy adults have slightly higher 
sweat chloride concentrations than do children, but the same guide­
lines hold for positive tests in adults. The non-­CF conditions yielding 
elevated sweat chloride concentrations are listed in Table 3.20. False-­
negative results of sweat tests can be seen in CF children presenting

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
with edema or hypoproteinemia and in samples from children with 
an inadequate sweat rate. Sweat testing can be performed at any age. 
Newborns within the first few weeks of life may not produce a large 
enough volume of sweat to analyze (75 mg minimum), but in those 
who do (the majority), the results are accurate. Indications for sweat 
testing are noted in Table 3.21.
In patients for whom sweat testing is difficult (e.g., because of 
distance from an experienced laboratory, small infants who have not 
produced enough sweat, patients with extreme dermatitis, or patients 
with intermediate-­range sweat chloride concentrations), CFTR gene 
sequencing can be useful. Demonstration of two known CF variants 
confirms the diagnosis. Finding one or no known variant makes the 
diagnosis less likely but is not exclusive, inasmuch as there are patients 
with not-­yet-­characterized variants.
Recovery of mucoid P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract secretions 
is strongly suggestive of CF. Similarly, pansinusitis is nearly universal 
among CF patients but is quite uncommon in other children. All 50 
states are using a neonatal screen for CF. The CF screen assays include 
measuring serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, which are 
elevated in most infants with CF for the first several weeks of life, and 
DNA analysis for CFTR variants. The main drawback of the IRT assay 
is that it has relatively poor specificity; as many as 90% of the positive 
results on the initial screen are false-­positive results. If an infant’s IRT 
screen is positive, the test should be repeated, or DNA analysis for the 
23 most common CFTR variants should be performed. At 2–3 weeks 
of age, which is when the IRT is repeated, the false-­positive rate has 
fallen dramatically but is still quite high (25%). Definitive testing with 
the sweat chloride test needs to be carried out on infants with positive 
screening results.
Laboratory data that may support the diagnosis of CF include low 
levels of fecal elastase. This suggests pancreatic insufficiency, which 
occurs most commonly in CF but can be seen in other diseases. The 
test is not perfect for confirming CF as some CF patients have suffi­
cient pancreatic function. Pulmonary function test findings with an 
obstructive pattern, incompletely responsive to bronchodilators, are 
consistent with CF but, of course, can be seen in other conditions. 
Conversely, some patients with CF also have asthma and may show a 
marked response to a bronchodilator. Complications of CF that suggest 
the diagnosis are noted in Table 3.22.
The treatment of patients with CF requires a comprehensive 
approach, best performed in, or in conjunction with, an approved CF 
center. Several studies have shown survival to be significantly better in 
center-­based care than in non–center-­based care. CFTR gene modula­
tor therapy aims to increase or improve the function of the abnormal 
CFTR protein and has shown promising results over the past 5 years.
Anatomic Abnormalities
Table 3.23 lists the main anatomic abnormalities that cause cough.
Vascular rings and slings. Vascular rings and slings are often 
associated with inspiratory stridor because the abnormal vessels 
compress central airways, most commonly the trachea (see Chapter 
4). The patient may also have difficulty swallowing if the esophagus is 
compressed.
The diagnosis may be suspected from plain radiographs of the chest, 
especially those showing tracheal deviation and a right-­sided aortic 
arch. Further support for the diagnosis can be found at bronchoscopy 
(which shows extrinsic compression of the trachea or a mainstem 
bronchus), barium esophagram (which shows esophageal compres­
sion), or both. The definitive diagnosis is made with CT angiography 
or magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment is surgical.
Pulmonary sequestration. Pulmonary sequestration is relatively 
unusual, occurring in 1 in 60,000 children. It occurs most commonly 
in the left lower lobe and can manifest in several ways (Fig. 3.12; see 
also Table 3.23). The chest radiograph usually shows a density in the 
left lower lobe; this density often appears to contain cysts (Fig. 3.13). 
The feature distinguishing a sequestered lobe from a complicated 
pneumonia is that the blood supply arises from the systemic circulation 
and not the pulmonary circulation. Doppler ultrasonography and CT

CHAPTER 3  Cough
angiography provide the definitive diagnosis. The treatment is surgical 
removal.
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation. Congenital pulmonary 
airway malformations (CPAMs) (formerly known as congenital cystic 
adenomatoid malformations or CCAMs) are rare. They manifest in 
infancy with respiratory distress in nearly 50% of cases; the other half 
may manifest as cough with recurrent infection later in childhood or 
even adulthood. The chest radiograph reveals multiple cysts, separated 
by dense areas. Chest CT scans can help make the diagnosis with near 
certainty. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice, particularly if the 
lesion is symptomatic.
Congenital lobar emphysema. Congenital lobar emphysema has 
a prevalence of 1 in 20,000–30,000. It can manifest dramatically with 
respiratory distress in the neonatal period or later (Fig. 3.14), with 
cough or wheeze, or as an incidental finding on a chest radiograph. 
Radiography shows localized overinflation, often dramatic, with 
compression of adjacent lung tissue and occasionally atelectasis of the 
contralateral lung because of mediastinal shift away from the involved 
side. The appearance on chest CT scan is typical, with widely spaced 
blood vessels (as opposed to congenital cysts, for example, which have 
no blood vessels within the overinflated area). Bronchoscopy can 
document patent bronchi and should probably be performed in older 
children in whom congenital lobar emphysema can be confused with 
acquired overinflation of a lobe as the result of bronchial obstruction, as 
with a foreign body. If the disease is symptomatic, treatment is surgical.
Tracheoesophageal fistula. Tracheoesophageal fistula is common, 
with an incidence of about 1 in 2,500–4,500 live births. Of these fistulas, 
the large majority (85%) are associated with esophageal atresia; only 3% 
are the isolated, H-­type fistula (a patent esophagus with fistulous tract 
connecting the esophagus and trachea). A neonate with esophageal 
atresia experiences respiratory distress, excessive drooling, and choking 
and gagging with feeding. The H-­type fistula causes more subtle signs 
and may be undiagnosed for months or even years. The child may have 
only intermittent feeding trouble, especially with liquids. There may be 
recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
The diagnosis is not challenging in the infant with esophageal 
atresia; a nasogastric tube cannot be passed, and swallowed barium 
outlines the trachea. In the older child with H-­type fistula, a barium 
esophagogram may or may not reveal the fistula. Bronchoscopy and 
esophagoscopy should permit direct visualization of the fistula; how­
ever, the opening may be hidden in mucosal folds.
Treatment is surgical. Many children born with tracheoesopha­
geal fistula have recurrent cough and lower respiratory tract infection 
for many years, even after successful surgical correction. The cough 
is characteristically the harsh cough of tracheomalacia, which is pres­
ent at the site of the fistula. The infections result from several causes, 
including GER due to impaired esophageal motility, with or without 
aspiration, and altered mucociliary transport. Treatment involves reg­
ular chest physiotherapy and early and aggressive use of antibiotics 
whenever there is evidence of increased pulmonary symptoms.
Hemangiomas. Hemangiomas may be present within the airway and 
can cause cough, rarely with hemoptysis. Stridor (if the hemangioma is 
high in the airway) and respiratory distress (if the hemangioma is large) 
may also occur. In rare cases, with very large airway hemangiomas, 
there may even be dysphagia from extrinsic compression. Children 
with cutaneous hemangiomas in the mandibular or neck region 
(“beard” distribution) are at risk for an airway hemangioma.
The diagnosis is made with bronchoscopy. These lesions may resolve 
spontaneously over the first year or so. However, if they cause symp­
toms, it may not be advisable or possible to wait for them to resolve.
Many airway hemangiomas regress with steroid treatment; how­
ever, due to the side effect profile, propranolol is considered the treat­
ment of choice. Asthma is a contraindication for propranolol treatment 
due to its beta-­blocking effect and potential to worsen asthma. Laser 
ablation may be indicated in some refractory cases that do not respond 
to first-­line treatment. In the case of a large subglottic hemangioma, a 
tracheostomy is performed and maintained until the mass regresses.
Enlarged lymph nodes. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, such 
as those resulting from tuberculosis, leukemia, other hematologic 
malignancies, or other infections, are occasionally a cause of cough in 
children (Table 3.24; see also Table 3.23). These nodes are usually seen 
on plain radiographs of the chest. The x-­ray study or bronchoscopy 
may show extrinsic compression of the trachea. Treatment is directed 
at the underlying cause.
Bronchial stenosis. Occasionally bronchial stenosis, either 
congenital or acquired, may cause cough. The diagnosis is made with

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
bronchoscopy, after suspicion has been raised by the child having 
recurrent infiltrates in the same lobe, especially with localized wheeze.
Treatment may be difficult. In some cases, endoscopic balloon dila­
tation or airway stent placement is successful; in others, surgical resec­
tion of stenotic areas may be necessary.
Bronchogenic cysts. Bronchogenic cysts are uncommon, but they 
can cause cough, wheeze, stridor, or any combination of these. They 
may also cause recurrent or persistent pneumonia if they block a 
bronchus sufficiently to interfere with normal drainage of the segment 
or lobe. Radiography may show localized overinflation if the cyst causes 
a ball-­valve–type obstruction. The cyst itself may or may not be seen on 
plain radiographs. Bronchoscopy reveals extrinsic compression of the 
airway. CT studies often definitively show the lesion. Surgical removal 
is indicated.
Other rare causes of cough. Certain genetic disorders such as 
hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSANs), in the 
absence of significant autonomic features, may first present with 
unexplained chronic cough and GER.
Habit (Psychogenic) Cough
On occasion, a school-­aged child may develop a cough that lasts for 
weeks, often after a fairly typical cold. This cough occurs only during 
wakefulness, never during sleep. In many cases, the cough is harsh and 
sounds like a foghorn. It can disrupt the classroom, and the child may 
be asked to leave. The child is otherwise well and may seem unbothered 
by the spectacle created. There is no response to medications. It seems 
that this type of cough, previously termed “psychogenic” or “psycho­
genic cough tic,” now called habit cough, has given the child valuable 
attention. This attention then serves as the sustaining force, and the 
cough persists beyond the original airway inflammation. In the small 
minority of cases, there may be deep-­seated emotional problems of 
which the cough is the physical expression.
During the history or physical examination, the child appears com­
pletely well and may cough when attention is drawn to the child or 
when the word “cough” is uttered. The physical examination findings 
are otherwise completely normal, as are laboratory values. Because this 
may occur in any child, evidence of mild asthma (history or pulmonary 
function testing) does not rule out the diagnosis. Once a physician has 
seen a child with this problem, it is usually possible to make the diag­
nosis with certainty on entering the examining room or, indeed, from 
the hallway outside the room.
Treatment can prove more difficult. The child and family should 
be reassured that the child is well. Suggestion therapy empowers and

encourages the patient to suppress the cough for short increments of 
time. The goal is for them to gradually lengthen the cough-­free inter­
vals. Speech therapy may be helpful (Table 3.25).
Other Causes of Cough
Table 3.26 lists several miscellaneous causes of cough in children.
Bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is defined as an abnormal dilatation 
of the subsegmental bronchi and is usually associated with chronic 
cough and purulent sputum production. It occasionally occurs after 
severe pneumonias (bacterial or viral); it eventually develops in 
nearly all patients with CF. Recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis 
(over three episodes in 1 year) may be a sign of or a precursor to 
bronchiectasis. Diagnosis may, on occasion, be made with plain

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
chest radiographs, but high-­resolution CT scanning is the diagnostic 
procedure of choice. Treatment of bronchiectasis consists of airway 
clearance with chest physiotherapy and postural drainage or high-­
frequency chest wall oscillation, occasionally bronchodilators and 
mucolytic agents, and antibiotic therapy during exacerbations. Surgical 
resection may be indicated in cases that are progressive and localized 
when medical therapy has failed. The prognosis of bronchiectasis 
depends on the underlying cause. CF-­associated bronchiectasis is a 
major cause of CF-­related morbidity and mortality, whereas non-­CF 
bronchiectasis may remain stable or even regress with therapy.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia. Conditions in which the cilia do not 
function properly (immotile cilia or ciliary dyskinesia) lead to cough, 
usually because infection (and bronchiectasis) occurs in the absence of 
normal mucociliary transport. Diagnosis includes exhaled or nasal low 
nitric oxide levels, bronchoscopic biopsy, and specific genetic testing. 
Treatment is similar to that for CF, with regular chest physiotherapy 
and frequent and aggressive use of antibiotics at the first sign of airways 
infection, most commonly increased cough.
Interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung diseases are classified 
based on those that occur during the neonatal period and those that 
are not as prevalent in infancy. Interstitial lung diseases that manifest 
with cough include aspiration (chronic and recurrent) pneumonitis, 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and cryptogenic 
organizing pneumonia (formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans 
organizing pneumonia or BOOP). Lung biopsy may be required for 
a diagnosis.
Pulmonary hemosiderosis. Pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare, and 
often fatal, condition of bleeding into the lung that can manifest with 
cough. If sputum is produced, it is often frothy and blood-­tinged. There 
may be frank hemoptysis. However, the cough may be nonproductive, 
or the sputum may be swallowed. Some cases are associated with 
milk hypersensitivity (Heiner syndrome), and others are associated 
with collagen vascular disorders. Radiographs usually show diffuse 
fluffy infiltrates, and there is invariably iron-­deficiency anemia. The 
diagnosis is based on lung biopsy findings.
Primary and metastatic tumors. Tumors causing cough are rare in 
childhood. Cough usually occurs because of bronchial obstruction, 
either extrinsic or endobronchial, resulting at times in recurrent 
obstructive pneumonias (Table 3.27).
Bronchogenic tumors (carcinoid, mucoepidermoid carcinoma 
[MEC], bronchial adenocarcinoma [BAC], inflammatory myofibro­
blastic tumor [IMT]) may present with cough, recurrent obstructive 
pneumonias, wheezing, hemoptysis, and chest pain (Fig. 3.15). Carci­
noid is the most common bronchial tumor followed by MEC, BAC, and 
IMT. Carcinoid tumors rarely manifest vasoactive carcinoid syndrome 
symptoms (<5%) but may be associated with Cushing syndrome.
Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) usually presents under age 3 
years and is often associated with the DICER1 tumor susceptibility 
syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease. There are four subtypes: 
1, cystic; 2, mixed; 3, solid; and 1r, regressing. Type 1 may be confused 
with a cystic CPAM. PPB may present with cough, wheezing, pneumo­
nia, or pneumothorax.
The evaluation of a suspected primary or metastatic tumor includes 
chest x-­ray, bronchoscopy, CT angiography, and, to evaluate for meta­
static disease, PET-­MRI (see Fig. 3.15). Treatment usually requires sur­
gical resection in addition to other tumor-­specific therapies.
Tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia. Isolated tracheomalacia or 
bronchomalacia is uncommon but can cause cough in some children. 
The cough of tracheomalacia is typically harsh and brassy. Specific 
treatment is difficult but, fortunately, is seldom needed.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
Spasmodic croup. Some children, usually preschoolers, may 
episodically awaken at night with stridor and a harsh, barking cough 
indistinguishable from that of viral croup. This entity is termed 
spasmodic croup and is of unclear origin. Viral and allergic causes have 
been postulated. GER may be the cause in some patients.
Treatment with cool mist or racemic epinephrine is effective in 
most patients. If GER is the underlying cause, antireflux treatment is 
beneficial.
Bronchiolitis obliterans. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is very 
rare except in lung and bone marrow transplant recipients. In 
other instances, it may arise after adenovirus, measles, or influenza 
pneumonia; after exposure to certain toxins; or in other rare cir­
cumstances. Children may exhibit cough, respiratory distress, and 
exercise intolerance.
The diagnosis is suggested by the pulmonary function test or radio­
graphic evidence of small airways obstruction; however, these findings are 
not always present. Not all chest radiographs show overinflated lungs, and 
not all pulmonary function tests show decreased small airways function.
The definitive diagnosis is histologic via open or transbronchial 
biopsy. No specific treatment is available. Most children with BO 
recover but many progress to chronic disability or death.
Hemoptysis
The child who coughs out blood or bloody mucus presents special diag­
nostic and therapeutic challenges. Although hemoptysis is relatively 
uncommon in children, particularly among those without CF, many 
conditions can cause it (Table 3.28). It is important (and not always 
easy) to distinguish cases in which blood has originated in the tracheo­
bronchial tree (true hemoptysis), the nose (epistaxis), and the gastro­
intestinal tract (hematemesis). Table 3.29 gives some guidelines to help 
localize sites of origin of blood that has been reported or suspected as 
hemoptysis. None of these guidelines is foolproof, partly because blood 
that has originated in one of these sites might well end up in another 
before being expelled from the body; for instance, blood from the nose 
can be swallowed and vomited or aspirated and expectorated.
Infection is among the most common causes of hemoptysis. Lung 
abscess and tuberculosis need to be considered. Bronchiectasis can 
readily cause erosion into bronchial vessels, often made tortuous by 
years of local inflammation, and produce hemoptysis. Other infectious 
causes are less common and include necrotizing pneumonias and fun­
gal and parasitic lung invasion.
Foreign bodies in the airway can cause hemoptysis by direct irrita­
tion, by erosion of airway mucosa, or by secondary infection.
Pulmonary embolus is uncommon in children and adolescents, 
but it needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of an ado­
lescent with hemoptysis of unclear origin. Clues to the diagnosis of 
pulmonary embolus include a positive family history, severe dyspnea, 
chest pain, hypoxia, a normal chest radiograph, an accentuated sec­
ond heart sound, an abnormal compression ultrasonographic study of 
the leg veins, a positive Homans sign, a positive helical CT scan, and a 
high-­probability lung ventilation-­perfusion scan.
The diagnosis of several causes of hemoptysis is straightforward. 
For example, hemoptysis that occurs immediately after a surgical or 
invasive diagnostic procedure in the chest should suggest an iatrogenic 
problem. The chest radiograph can help suggest lung abscess, pulmo­
nary sequestration, bronchogenic cyst, or tumor. Chest CT can help 
with cases of arteriovenous malformations, and additional laboratory 
values can support the diagnosis of collagen vascular disease. Bron­
choscopy can sometimes localize a bleeding site, identify a cause (e.g., 
a foreign body or endobronchial tumor), or recover an offending bac­
terial, fungal, or parasitic pathogen. In many instances, bronchoscopy 
does not help except by excluding some possibilities, because either no 
blood or blood throughout the tracheobronchial tree is found. Chest 
CT angiography may help to identify the involved vessel or vessels.
Treatment of hemoptysis depends on the underlying cause. It can be 
a terrifying symptom to children and their parents, and a calm, reas­
suring approach is essential. Because hemoptysis is seldom fatal in chil­
dren, reassurance is usually warranted. Furthermore, hemoptysis most 
often resolves, and treatment of the bleeding itself is not often needed. 
What is required is treatment of the underlying cause of the hemop­
tysis, such as therapy for infection, removal of a foreign body, or con­
trol of collagen vascular disease. When death occurs from hemoptysis, 
it is more likely to be from suffocation than from exsanguination. In 
cases of massive bleeding, the rigid open-­tube bronchoscope may help

SECTION 2  Respiratory Disorders
suction large amounts of blood while ventilating and keeping unaf­
fected portions of the lung clear of blood. Interventional radiologists 
treat as well as localize a bleeding site by injecting the offending vessel 
with occlusive substances (embolization). In extremely rare instances, 
emergency lobectomy may be indicated.
WHEN COUGH ITSELF IS A PROBLEM
Cough itself seldom necessitates specific treatment. Nonetheless, cough 
is not always completely benign (see Table 3.9). Most complications are 
uncommon, and most accompany only very severe cough, but some 
are serious enough to justify treatment of the cough itself.
Cough suppressants include codeine, hydrocodone (two narcotics), 
or dextromethorphan (a non-narcotic D-­isomer of the codeine ana­
log of levorphanol). Such agents should be used only for severe cough 
that may produce significant complications (see Table 3.9). For most 
diseases, suppressing the cough offers no advantage. Disadvantages 
include narcotic addiction and loss of the protective cough reflex with 
subsequent mucous retention and possible superinfection. Demulcent 
preparations (sugar-­containing, bland soothing agents or honey) tem­
porarily suppress the cough response from pharyngeal sources, and 
decongestant-­antihistamine combinations may reduce postnasal drip. 
Cough medications should not be used in children under 4 years of age.

CHAPTER 3  Cough
   	 S U MMA RY  A N D  R E D  F L A G S
Cough is important because it is a symptom and sign of underlying 
disease that frequently merits treatment. In the acute setting, severe 
disease, including massive hemoptysis or profound dyspnea or hypox­
emia, warrants immediate attention, rapid diagnosis, and rapid man­
agement. Certain chronic conditions, including those that suggest 
CF and those in which symptoms have persisted and interfere with a 
child’s daily activities and quality of life, warrant further evaluation and 
treatment. Finally, a child whose cough fails to respond to what should 
have been reasonable treatment should be referred to a pulmonary spe­
cialist (Table 3.30).
