AI EXPERT
- “Fast” and “Slow” Systems:
    - “Fast” → Dialogue Agent:
        - Immediately takes in student input and outputs a response given the newest context with an LLM  (LearnLM?)
        - Does not necessarily need context to function
    - “Slow” → Reasoning Agent:
        - Creates context for the dialogue agent given:
            - Student Input
            - Patient Conversation History
            - Expert Conversation History
            - Medical Guidelines
                - Filtered with RAG at the beginning of the case, based on the case
            - Patient Info
            - Student’s Performance Record
        - Can create context even before the student initiates a conversation with prior data
        - Refines data with an MedGemma into an organized structure for the current context
        - The current context encapsulates all the information about what the patient has told the student, the student’s assumptions, what the student doesn’t know, and the correct information and procedure.
